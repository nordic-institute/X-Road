## 6.17.0 - 2018-02-14
- PVAYLADEV-861 / XRJD #172: Built a mechanism for configuration loader, that allows the loading of mutually alternative configuration files without unnecessary log errors. This mechanism is used to load explicit configuration values from either proxy, center or confproxy components on signer startup. Also refactored central server UI configuration loading to avoid unnecessary log errors. Update performs a migration for existing local configuration values if needed.

- PVAYLADEV-809 / XRJD #190: The xroad package xroad-common has been split into four packages to allow removing unnecessary dependencies in the future. The package xroad-common still remains but is now a metapackage that depends on the new packages xroad-nginx, xroad-confclient, and xroad-signer which in turn depend on the new package xroad-base. X-Road packages that were dependant on xroad-common are, for now, still dependant on that package.
- PVAYLADEV-921: Ansible playbook support for selecting the security server variant (ee, fi, vanilla) to be installed, defaults to vanilla

- PVAYLADEV-438 / XRDJ #57 	For security reasons, security server metaservice no longer returns the network addresses of subsystem's services when retrieving the WSDL of a service. Instead it returns "http://example.org/xroad-endpoint".
- PVAYLADEV-822 / XRJD #162 	Environmental monitoring data now shows fewer certificate details, but for more certificates. SHA-1 hashes and validity periods (start and end date) are shown. The certificate data still contains the authentication and signing certificates and as a new addition, the internal TLS certificate for the security server as well as the client information system authentication certificates. The aim is to provide details about expiring certificates that would prevent message delivery but keep any private certificate details private.
- PVAYLADEV-860 / XRJD #168	The central server's environmental monitoring component is installed by default.

Removed XRoadSizeBasedRollingPolicy from the logback configurations. The policy class remains available (in case someone really wants to use it for awhile still), but will be removed entirely in a future release. Due to the log rolling policy change, the file name of archived files will lose the zip-creation time from the custom policy.
- PVAYLADEV-807: Added a maintenance mode to the health check interface to force health check to return HTTP status code 503. Mode can be enabled through proxy's admin port.
- PVAYLADEV-746: Added environment monitoring sensor for certificates which are associated with this security server.

- PVAYLADEV-760 / XRJD #160: Modified connector SO-linger defaults to -1. Additionally moved RHEL-proxy configuration to file override-rhel-proxy.ini and reduced the file to only contain differences to debian-proxy configuration file proxy.ini, that is now also included in RHEL packaging as a baseline configuration. Also modified SystemPropertiesLoader to load glob-defined ini-files in alphabetic order based on the filename.
- PVAYLADEV-798 / XRJD #170: Fixed the horizontal centering of central server UI tab bars as well as the vertical positioning of the advanced search window tab bar.
- PVAYLADEV-818: Updated the frontpage of X-Road Github repository (README.md file) to contain more information about the X-Road development.
- PVAYLADEV-816: Add missing load balancing installation document image source files
- PVAYLADEV-772: The X-Road restore backup script names the services that need to be restarted so that the service list is always correct and the services are restarted in correct order.
- PVAYLADEV-797 / XRJD #156: Federation has been disabled by default on the security server level. Federation can be enabled with the system parameter allowed-federations for the configuration-client server component. More information can be found in the Security Server User Guide (Doc. ID: UG-SS) and the System Parameters User Guide (Doc. ID: UG-SYSPAR)
- PVAYLADEV-868:Added link from ig-xlb_x-road_external_load_balancer_installation_guide.md to /doc/README.md

- Updated example Zabbix related scripts and configuration files

## 6.9.0 - 2017-01-06

- PVAYLADEV-505: Fixed a bug in Security Server's UI that was causing the text in the pop-window to be messed with HTML code in some cases when "Remove selected" button was clicked.
- PVAYLADEV-484: Changed the value of Finnish setting for time-stamping of messages (acceptable-timestamp-failure-period parameter). Value was increased from value 1800s to value 18000s. By this change faults related to time-stamping functionality will be decreased.
- PVAYLADEV-475 / Joint Development issue #70: Security Server's connection pool functionality improved so that existing and already opened connections will re-used more effectively. Old implementation was always opening a new connection when a new message was sent. This new functionality will boost performance of Security Server several percents. Global settings use the old functionality by default but the Finnish installation packages override the global setting, opting to use the improvements. See the system parameters documentation UG-SYSPAR for more details.  
- PVAYLADEV-523: An Ansible script for installing the test-CA was created and published in the Github repository. The script will execute the installation automatically without any manual actions needed.
- PVAYLADEV-536: Improved OCSP diagnostics and logging when handling a certificate issued by an intermediate (non-root) certificate authority: The certificates are now listed in OCSP diagnostics and a false positive error message is no longer logged.
- PVAYLADEV-467 / PVAYLADEV-468 / PVAYLADEV-469 / PVAYLADEV-553 / Joint Development issue #81: Several improvements and checks to make sure there are no security threats related to Security Server's user rights and system generated files:
  - /var/tmp/xroad and /var/log/xroad folders checked and user rights validated
  - /var/lib/xroad folder user rights restricted
  - /var/log/secure and /var/log/up2date folders checked through and validated if files generated here are necessary
  - /var/log/messages folder checked through and validated if files generated here are necessary. Fixed functionality so that xroad-confclient is not writing log files to this folder if it is running as a service.
  - N.B! if there are monitoring actions and processed related to xroad-confclient, that are using log files of this folder, the configuration of monitoring must be changed so that the source of logs is from now on /var/log/xroad folder.
- PVAYLADEV-556: All installed additional parts of Central Server are seen on UI of Central Server. Earlier some parts that where installed could not be seen on UI.
- PVAYLADEV-531: Fixed the bug in functionality of "Unregister" dialog window in security server's "Keys and Certificates" -view so that no nonsensical error messages are shown to user. Erroneous notification was shown if user had created an authentication certificate and then made a request to register it and immediately canceled the request before it was accepted. This caused an unexpected error text from the Keys -table to be translated and the subsequent message to be shown to the user. The underlying error was a fixed removing any unnecessary error messages.
- PVAYLADEV-560 / Joint Development issue #65: Improved the handling of OCSP responses at startup phase of Security Server. If at startup the global configuration is expired then the next OCSP validation is scheduled within one minute. In earlier versions this was scheduled within one hour and caused extra delay until OCSP status was 'good'. Also, error message 'Server has no valid authentication' was generated.
- PVAYLADEV-489 / PVAYLADEV-571 / Joint Development issue #69: From version 6.9.0 Security Server is supporting new XML schema that makes possible to use a set of different Global Configuration versions. This makes possible that Global Configuration can be updated without breaking the compatibility to the Security Servers that are still using the older version of Global Configuration. Each Security Server knows the correct Global Configuration version it is using and based on this information is able to request that version from the Central Server. Central Server in turn is able to distribute all the Global Configurations that might be in use.
- PVAYLADEV-570 / Joint Development issue #69: From version 6.9.0 Configuration Proxy supports a new XML schema that makes it possible to use a set of different Global Configuration versions. Configuration Proxy can download, cache and distribute all the Global Configurations that might be in use.
- PVAYLADEV-588 / Joint Development issue #64: Fixed a bug that caused Security Server to start doing duplicate OCSP fetches at the same time. This happened if two or more OCSP related parameter values were changed (almost) at the same time.
- PVAYLADEV-457: Improved the INFO level logging information of Signer module so that more information will be written to log. It makes easier to see afterward what Signer has been doing.
- PVAYLADEV-607 / Joint Development issue #69: Global Configuration version that is generated and distributed by default can be set both in Central Server and Configuration Proxy (using a parameter value).
- PVAYLADEV-616: Fixed a bug in environment monitoring causing file handles not to be closed properly.
- PVAYLADEV-618 / Joint Development issue #89: Partial index is created to messagelog database so that non-archived messages will be fetched faster. This change will make the archiver process much faster.
- PVAYLADEV-634 / Joint Development issue #96: Fixed a bug in 'Generate certificate request' dialog. A refactored method was not updated to certificate request generation from System Parameters -view which caused the certificate generation to fail with the error message "Undefined method".

## 6.8.11 - 2016-12-20
- Added documents: PR-OPMON, PR-OPMONJMX, ARC-OPMOND, UG-OPMONSYSPAR
- Updated documents: ARC-G, ARC-SS, UC-OPMON, UG-SS, TEST_OPMON, TEST_OPMONSTRAT

## 6.8.10 - 2016-12-12

- CDATA parsing fix (XTE-262)
- Converting PR-MESS to Markdown

## 6.8.7 - 2016-10-21
- DOM parser replacement with SAX parser (XTE-262)

## 6.8.6 - 2016-09-30
- Fixed: security server processes MIME message incorrectly if there is a "\t" symbol before boundary parameter (XTE-265)
- Documentation update: apt-get upgrade does not upgrade security server from 6.8.3 to 6.8.5 (XTE-278)
- Added xroad-securityserver conflicts uxp-addon-monitoring <= 6.4.0

## 6.7.13 - 2016-09-20
 - PVAYLADEV-485: Fixed a bug in the message archiver functionality that caused very long filenames or filenames including XML to crash the archiver process.
 - PVAYLADEV-398: Security Server backup/restore functionality fixed to work also when the existing backup is restored to a clean environment (new installation of a Security Server to a new environment).
 - PVAYLADEV-238: OCSP dianostic UI now shows the connection status. Color codes:
   - Green: Ok
   - Yellow: Unknown status
   - Red: Connection cannot be established to OCSP service or OCSP response could not be interpreted or no response from OCSP service
 - PVAYLADEV-360: Namespace prefixes other than 'SOAP-ENV' for SOAP fault messages are now supported. Previously other prefixes caused an error.
 - PVAYLADEV-424: Improved the messagelog archiver functionality so that it cannot consume an unlimited amount of memory even if there would be tens of thousands of messages to archive.
 - PVAYLADEV-304: Fixed a situation that caused time-stamping to get stuck if some (rare) preconditions were realized.
 - PVAYLADEV-351: Performance of Security Server improved by optimizing database queries at the time when Security Server's configuration data is fetched.
 - PVAYLADEV-454: Adjusted the amount of metaspace memory available for xroad processes so that the signer service does not run out of memory.
 - PVAYLADEV-416: Added Security Server support for the old Finnish certificate profile used in the FI-DEV environment.
 - PVAYLADEV-459 / PVAYLADEV-352 / PVAYLADEV-460 / PVAYLADEV-461: Several improvements to OCSP protocol related functionalities:
    - After a failure to fetch an OCSP respose, fetch retries are now scheduled based on the Fibonacci Sequence. The first retry is done after 10 seconds, then after 20 seconds, then after 30 seconds, 50 seconds, 80 seconds, 130 seconds etc. until a successful OCSP response is fetched.
    - Validation of OCSP response is done only once per message and the validation result is then stored to cache. If result is needed later, cache will be used for checking the result. This change will make the checking faster.
    - OCSP responses are fetched by the time interval defined in Global Configuration so that the Security Server is able to operate longer in a case on OCSP service is down.
    - OCSP response is no longer fetched immediately if ocspFreshnessSeconds or nextUpdate parameter values are changed. This allows the Security Server to operate longer in case the OCSP service is down and the parameters are changed to avoid calling the unreachable OCSP service.
 - PVAYLADEV-353: Added system parameters to stop the security servers from leaking TCP connections between them. These settings maintain status quo by default so connections are leaked without configuration changes. The prevention is overridden to be enabled in the Finnish installation package. The added configuration options are described in the UG-SYSPAR document. In short, configuring the [proxy] on the server side with server-connector-max-idle-time=120000 will close idle connections after 120 seconds.
 - PVAYLADEV-455 / PVAYLADEV-458: Updated several Security Server dependency packages to the latest version so that possible vulnerabilities are fixed.
 - PVAYLADEV-400: Security Server UI: when adding a new subsystem only subsystems that are owned by the organization are visible by default. Previously all the subsystems were visible (all the registered subsystems).
 - PVAYLADEV-464: Security Server UI: implemented 'Certificate Profile Info' feature for Finnish certificates which allows the UI to automatically fill most of the necessary fields when creating a new certificate request (either sign or auth certificate request).
 - PVAYLADEV-476: Improved the performance of Security Server by optimizing the caching of global configuration.
 - Bug fixes and minor enhancements
