## 1 General

### 1.1 Preamble

This document describes database model of X-Road security server. 

### 1.2 Database Version

This database assumes PostgreSQL version 9.2 or later.

### 1.3 Creating, Backing Up and Restoring the Database

This database is integrated into X-Road security server application. The database management functions are embedded into the application user interface.
The database, the database user and the data model is created by the application's installer. The database updates are packaged as application updates and are applied when the application is upgraded. From the technical point of view, the database structure is created and updated using [Liquibase](http://www.liquibase.org/) tool. The migration scripts can be found both in application source and in file system of the installed application.
Database backup functionality is built into the application. The backup operation can be invoked from the web-based user interface or from the command line. The backup contains dump of all the database structure and contents. When restoring the application, first the software is installed and then the configuration database is restored together with all the other necessary files. This produces a working security server. 
Note: backing up of security server does not include message log that is managed using different tools.

### 1.4 Saving Database History

This section describes a general mechanism for storing history of the database tables. All the history-aware tables have associated trigger update_history that records all the modifications to data. All the tables of security server database are history-aware, except for

  * history
  * databasechangelog
  * databasechangeloglock

When a row is created, updated or deleted in one of the history-aware tables, the trigger update_history is activated and invokes the stored procedure add_history_rows. For each changed column, add_history_rows inserts a row into the history table. The details of the stored procedures are described in section 1.6.

### 1.5 Entity-Relationship Diagram

![Entity-Relationship Diagram](img/dm-ss_x-road_security_server_configuration_data_model.svg)

### 1.6 List of Stored Procedures

1. add_history_rows: Detects the changes made as a result of the operation it is invoked on, and calls the insert_history_row stored procedure to insert a row to the history table, for each changed field. For insertions and deletions, a history record is inserted for each field of the original table.
2. insert_history_row: Inserts a single row with values corresponding to a changed field in one of the database tables. Invoked by the add_history_rows stored procedure.

### 1.7 List of Triggers

1. update_history: Invokes the add_history_rows stored procedure upon insertions, updates and deletions of records. Created for each history-aware table.

## 2 Description of Entities

### 2.1 ACCESSRIGHT

Access right of a security server client or a group of clients to use a particular service. An access right record is created when an access right for a service is granted. The record is deleted when the service is removed from the system configuration or the access right is forfeited. The record is never modified.

| role | character varying(255) | NOT NULL | Role name. Check constraint `valid_role` limits value to valid ones. |

### 2.4 CERTIFICATE

Trusted authentication certificate associated with an information system belonging to a particular security server client. A certificate record is created when a certificate is uploaded for a security server client. The record is deleted when the certificate is deleted from the system configuration. The record is never modified.

#### 2.4.1 Attributes

| Name        | Type           | Modifiers        | Description           |

| client_id [FK] | bigint | | The security server client whose information system server uses this authentication certificate. References id attribute of CLIENT entity. |

### 2.5 CLIENT

Member or subsystem that is using this security server. The security server owner is also registered as a client.
For owner, the record is created when the administrator initializes the security server. For security server users, the record is created when the administrator adds new client in the user interface.
The client record is deleted when the administrator removes the client in the user interface. The client record corresponding to the owner cannot be deleted.
The client record is modified when administrator changes parameters in the user interface or when automatic status update occurs (see below).
The field clientstatus shows the progress of registering in central server the connection between this security server client and this security server. Only in “registered” state can the security server exchange messages on behalf of this client.

* _saved_ -- initial state. Client enters it immediately after creation. From this state the administrator can send registration request to the central server.
* _registration in progress_ -- the administrator has successfully sent registration request to the central server. In this state the security server is waiting for approval of the client registration request. When the security server receives a global configuration that contains connection between the security server and the client, it enters the “registered” state.
* _registered_ -- the registration request sent to the central server is approved and the connection between the client and the security server is registered in the global configuration. In this state the security server can exchange messages on behalf of the client.
* _deletion in progress_ -- the security server has successfully sent client deletion request to the central server. From this state, the only possible action is to delete the client from security server configuration.
* _global error_ -- the client was in state “registered”, but the connection between the client and the security server has been deleted from the global configuration. From this state the administrator can either wait for updated global configuration (in case the deletion was caused by an error), contact the systems administrator of the central server or delete the client.
* _disabled_ -- the client is temporarily disabled
* _disabling in progress__ -- the administrator has successfully sent clientDisable request. When the security server receives updated global configuration, it enters the "disabled" state. 
* _enabling in progress__ -- the administrator has successfully sent clientEnable request. When the security server receives updated global configuration, it returns to "registered" state.

### 2.11 LOCALGROUP

Group of members and/or subsystems. The group is local to a security server client and is used in access rights management. Local groups are connected to a security server client and can only be used for services belonging to that client.

The record is deleted when the administrator deletes the group or the security server client for whom the group is defined.

The record is deleted when the administrator deletes the WSDL containing the service description or when the administrator deletes the security server client owning the WSDL.

The data needed for verifying time stamps is read from the global configuration. A TSP record is created when the administrator adds a new TSP in the user interface. The record is deleted when the administrator deletes the TSP in the user interface. The record is never modified.
