# 1 General

## 1.1 Preamble

This document describes the database model of the X-Road Central Server.

## 1.2 Terms and abbreviations

See X-Road terms and abbreviations documentation \[[TA-TERMS](#Ref_TERMS)\].

### 1.3 References

1. <a id="Ref_TERMS" class="anchor"></a>\[TA-TERMS\] X-Road Terms and Abbreviations. Document ID: [TA-TERMS](../terms_x-road_docs.md).

## 1.4 Database Version

This database assumes PostgreSQL version 12 or later. Default settings are used in simple setup, while a custom configuration is used in HA setup.

## 1.5 Creating, Backing Up and Restoring the Database

This database is integrated into X-Road Central Server application. The database management functions are embedded into the application user interface.
The database, the database user and the data model is created by the application's installer. The database updates are packaged as application updates and are applied when the application is upgraded. From the technical point of view, the database structure is created and updated using [Liquibase](http://www.liquibase.org/) tool. The migration scripts can be found both in application source and in file system of the installed application.
Database backup functionality is built into the application. The backup operation can be invoked from the web-based user interface or from the command line. The backup contains dump of all the database structure and contents. When restoring the application, first the software is installed and then the configuration database is restored together with all the other necessary files. This produces a working Central Server.

## 1.6 Saving Database History

This section describes the general mechanism for storing the history of the database tables. All the history-aware tables have an associated trigger update_history that records all the modifications to data. All the tables of central database are history-aware, except for

- history,
- distributed_files

When a row is created, updated or deleted in one of the history-aware tables, the trigger update_history is activated and invokes the stored procedure add_history_rows. For each changed column, add_history_rows inserts a row into the history table. The details of the stored procedures are described in section 1.9.

## 1.7 High Availability Support

The High Availability (HA) solution for the X-Road Central Server relies on a shared, optionally highly available database. There can be multiple Central Server nodes each connecting to the same database instance. Furthermore, the database can be set up in high-availability mode where there is the primary node with read/write access and one or more secondary read-only nodes replicating the primary data as it changes.

In order to support high availability (HA) setup of the X-Road Central Server, some database tables have the ha_node_name field. In an HA setup, the name of the node of the cluster that initiated the insertion of a given record, is stored in that field. In ordinary setup, a default value is used. In both cases, this is done at the level of stored procedures as described in section 1.9.

The logic of taking into account the value of ha_node_name where applicable, has been implemented at the application level.

Database history records are aware of the node name in an HA setup and are replicated just like other records. Thus each node contains the full history of database changes. Because replication events happen at a lower level than insertions of records, the replication of history records themselves does not trigger any subsequent insertions of history records on target nodes.

## 1.8 Entity-Relationship Diagram

The data model is described in two entity relationship diagrams (ERD). The first diagram contains tables related to Security Servers and Security Server clients. The second diagram contains the rest of the tables.

![Entity-Relationship Diagram](img/dm-cs-central-server-database-diagram.svg)

Figure 1. ERD describing the database tables in the Central Server database

## 1.9 List of Stored Procedures

The following stored procedures are present in the database, regardless of whether a given Central Server has been installed in standalone or HA setup.

1. add_history_rows: Detects the changes made as a result of the operation it is invoked on, and calls the insert_history_row stored procedure to insert a row to the history table, for each changed field. For insertions and deletions, a history record is inserted for each field of the original table.
2. insert_history_row: Inserts a single row with values corresponding to a changed field in one of the database tables. Invoked by the add_history_rows stored procedure.
3. insert_node_name: For each record inserted to a table with the field ha_node_name, sets the value of this field to
- the default value in standalone systems
- the name of the cluster node that initiated the insertion, in an HA setup.

## 1.10 List of Triggers

The following triggers are present in the database, regardless of whether a given Central Server has been installed in standalone or HA setup.

1. `update_history`: Invokes the `add_history_rows` stored procedure upon insertions, updates and deletions of records. Created for each history-aware table.
2. `insert_node_name`: Invokes the `insert_node_name` stored procedure upon insertions. Created for each table with the ha_node_name field.

# 2 Description of Entities

## 2.1 ANCHOR_URL_CERTS

Certificate belonging to a configuration source that is represented in database by an anchor URL. The certificates are used to verify signed configuration downloaded from a given URL.

The record is created when an X-Road security officer has received trusted anchor from federation partner and uploads it in the user interface. The record is deleted when the federation contract between two X-Road instances has come to an end and an X-Road security officer deletes the anchor associated with the record in the user interface. The record is never modified. Records in tables trusted_anchors and anchor_urls are created and deleted in exactly the same way. See also documentation of these tables.

## 2.5 APPROVED_CAS

Approved certification authority (CA) that is used when verifying authentication and signing certificates. Exactly one top-level CA certificate is associated with each approved CA. Multiple intermediate CA certificates can be associated with each approved CA. The intermediate CA certificates form a hierarchy with top-level CA used as a trust anchor. The intermediate CAs are used for certificate path building and for finding OCSP responders.

New record creation process starts when an X-Road system administrator receives a certificate from a CA which is going to be trusted by the X-Road instance. Having received the certificate, an X-Road system administrator uploads it in the user interface. The record is deleted when for any reason the governing authority of the X-Road instance does not trust the CA any more. Then an X-Road system administrator deletes the approved CA in the user interface. The record is modified when the user changes parameters of the approved CA. Parameters that can be changed, are following:

1. Flag “authentication only”, see also documentation of the column authentication_only of this table.
2. Certificate profile info class name, see also documentation of the column cert_profile_info of this table.

| updated_at                                        | timestamp without time zone | NOT NULL | Record last modified time, managed automatically. |

## 2.6 APPROVED_TSAS

Approved time-stamping authority (TSA). The certificate of the approved CA is used for time-stamping signed messages.

New record creation process starts when an X-Road system administrator receives a certificate from a TSA which is going to be trusted by the X‑Road instance. Having received the certificate, an X-Road system administrator uploads it in the user interface. The record is created when the user adds new approved TSA in the user interface. The record is deleted when for any reason the governing authority of the X-Road instance does not trust the TSA any more. Then an X-Road system administrator deletes the approved TSA in the user interface. The record is modified when the user changes URL or uploads new certificate.

| created_at | timestamp without time zone | NOT NULL | Record creation time, managed automatically. |
| updated_at | timestamp without time zone | NOT NULL | Record last modified time, managed automatically. |

## 2.7 AUTH_CERTS

Authentication certificate that is used by a Security Server to establish secure connection. Each authentication certificate belongs to a particular Security Server.

The record is created when X-Road registration officer approves the request in the user interface. The record is removed whenever there is need to remove the Security Server the record belongs to or when the authentication certificate cannot be used any more. An X-Road registration officer can either remove Security Server or send authentication certificate deletion request for the Security Server in the user interface. The latter is done when only authentication certificate (without Security Server) is going to be deleted. The record is never modified. See also documentation of table security_servers.

## 2.8 CA_INFOS

CA certificates with additional data that is displayed in the user interface. The CA info can describe either certificate of a top-level CA or an intermediate CA. The record is created when a new top-level CA or an intermediate CA is added in the user interface.
The record is created on two occasions:

1. When a new approved CA is added in the user interface (for details, see documentation of table approved_cas), CA info corresponding to top CA is added.
2. When the certification chain of the approved CA includes intermediate CA-s. Then an X-Road system administrator adds intermediate CA certificate(s) in the user interface.

Accordingly, the record is deleted when either the approved CA is deleted (see also documentation of table approved_cas) or the intermediate CA is deleted in the user interface. The latter can happen when certification chain for approved CA changes. The record is never modified.

## 2.9 CONFIGURATION_SIGNING_KEYS

Signing context (key identifier used by the signer and signing certificate) for signing the global configuration. A signing key belongs to a configuration source. A configuration signing key is used when it is marked as active in the user interface. Technically it is done by designating the key as active key in the configuration_sources table, see also documentation of table configuration_sources.

The record is created when a new key for signing global configuration is needed (either no keys are present or any of present ones cannot be used). Then an X-Road security officer generates a new signing key in the user interface. Non-active configuration signing keys that are no longer necessary can be deleted by an X-Road security officer in the user interface. The record is never modified.

## 2.10 CONFIGURATION_SOURCES

Configuration source that the Central Server uses to distribute the global configuration. Stores (with associated configuration_signing_keys table) all the data necessary to generate configuration anchors for the Central Server. The configuration distributed by the source can be either internal configuration or external configuration. The internal configuration is distributed to Security Servers of this X-Road instance. The external configuration is distributed to the other X-Road instances (federation partners).

The configuration source is associated with several configuration signing keys. When generating a configuration anchor for the source, all the keys are included. One of the keys is marked active. Technically, the active key (in configuration_signing_keys table) is referred by the attribute active_key_id. The active key is used for signing configuration distributed by this source.

In an HA setup, each node of the cluster uses separate keys for signing configuration, and configuration anchors contain entries for each node of the cluster.
The record is created when the configuration source tab (either for internal or external configuration) is opened in the UI for the first time. The configuration source tab can be opened for viewing or editing configuration anchor or signing keys information for the configuration source. The record is modified when signing keys information of the configuration source is changed and a new configuration anchor is generated by the system. Also, the record is modified when an X-Road security officer generates a new configuration anchor in the user interface. The record is never deleted.

## 2.11 DISTRIBUTED_FILES

Stores global configuration files that are distributed to the X-Road members. There are three kinds of distributed files:

- private parameters (distributed to only members of this X-Road instance),
- shared parameters (distributed to members of this X-Road instance and to members of federation partners),
- other configuration files (optional, depends on the configuration of the instance. The supported optional configuration files are described in the system configuration).

The record can be created in two different ways:

- The record corresponding to either private or shared parameters is created when a new global configuration is generated. Global configuration is triggered periodically (every minute) by a cron job.
- The record corresponding to other configuration file is created when there is a need to distribute new version of a configuration file specific to the X-Road instance. Then an X-Road security officer on an X-Road registration officer uploads a new configuration part file in the user interface.

The record is always deleted before new record with particular file name is created. The record is never modified.

## 2.12 GLOBAL_GROUP_MEMBERS

Join table that associates global group member identifier with the global group the member belongs to. See also documentation of the table global_groups.

The record is created when a new member needs to be added to a global group. Then an X-Road registration officer adds global group member in the user interface. The record is deleted when a global group member or the group where the member belongs to is deleted in the user interface. The record is never modified.

The record is created when a new global group needs to be added to the X-Road instance. Then an X-Road registration officer adds new global group in the user interface. The record is modified when the group description is edited or members are added to or removed from the group by an X‑Road registration officer in the user interface. The record is deleted when the global group is deleted in the user interface by an X-Road registration officer.

## 2.15 IDENTIFIERS

Identifier that can be used to identify various objects on X-Road. An identifier record is only created together with records of other entities. There is no check of duplicates when new identifier record is added. The record is deleted when any record associated with the identifier is deleted. For example, when an entity of global_group_members is deleted, respective identifier is deleted as well. The record is never modified.

## 2.16 MEMBER_CLASSES

Member class supported by this X-Road instance. Member class has the purpose of grouping members with similar properties. A member class must have unique code inside the X-Road instance.

The record is added when the X-Road instance needs new member class. Then an X-Road system administrator adds a new member class in the user interface. The record is deleted when the member class is no longer necessary for this X-Road instance. Then an X-Road system administrator deletes the member class in the user interface. The description of the member class can be edited in the user interface.

## 2.18 REQUEST_PROCESSINGS

Processing status of the management request. Management requests are means of managing clients and authentication certificates of Security Servers. See also documentation of the table requests. 
- In older version request processing binds together two management requests that refer to the same data but have different origin (Security Server or user interface of the Central Server). If one request associated with the processing is from Central Server, the other one must be from Security Server and vice versa. 
- Starting in X-Road version 7.3.0 request_processing table contain only one record per request, there is no complementary request anymore.

Request processing can have one of following statuses:

- WAITING – Central Server has received a request. From this state, the user must either approve or decline the request.
- SUBMITTED FOR APPROVAL – Central Server has received two complementary requests from different sources. From this state, the user must either approve or decline the request. Starting in X-Road version 7.3.0 not used anymore.
- APPROVED – when the user approves the request, the processing enters APPROVED state. When entering this state the requested action (such as adding a client to a Security Server) is performed.
- REVOKED – when the processing is in WAITING state, respective deletion request can be sent to revoke the request. Deletion request can be sent from Security Server.
- DECLINED – when the processing is in WAITING state, it can be declined from the user interface if X-Road registration officer decides so.

Request processing record is created (registration requests for X-Road client and Security Server authentication certificate) from Security Server. Modifications to the record are related to changes of the request processing status and are described above in this section. The record is never deleted.

## 2.19 REQUESTS

Management request for creating or deleting association between X-Road member and Security Server. Management requests are divided into registration and deletion requests.

- Registration requests are submitted through X-Road Security Server. The request can be either approved or declined in the user interface of the Central Server. There are two types of registration requests: registration of a Security Server client and registration of Security Server's authentication certificate.
- Deletion requests are there to delete associations between X-Road clients, Security Servers and authentication certificates. Deletion requests are not associated with request processing. There are two types of deletion requests: deletion of Security Server's authentication certificate and  deletion of Security Server' client. Deletion request can be sent for following purposes:
  - if a registration request is mistakenly sent (from user interface of the Security Server), respective (with the same client, Security Server and/or authentication certificate data) deletion request can be sent to delete the bad registration request;
  - if authentication certificate of Central Server needs to be deleted, respective authentication certificate deletion request is sent either from user interface of the Central Server or Security Server;
  - if client of a Security Server needs to be removed, respective deletion request can be sent.

The record is created in the manner described above in this section. Starting in X-Road version 7.3.0 the record is never modified.
The record is never deleted.

## 2.20 SECURITY_SERVER_CLIENTS

Contains X-Road members or subsystems. The subject that can be associated with a Security Server. There are two types of associations:

- X-Road members can be Security Server owners. Members cannot provide and consume regular X-Road services (but can consume the X-Road management services).
- X-Road subsystems can be Security Server clients and can provide or consume X-Road services.

The way records are added depends on whether the record holds a member or a subsystem:

- members can be added in the user interface by the X-Road registration officer;
- subsystem can be added in the user interface by the X-Road registration officer and are also added when a client registration request for registering a subsystem that does not previously exist in this table is approved. See also documentation for tables requests and request_processings.

The record is modified when the X-Road registration officer edits the member's name in the user interface.

The record can be deleted in the user interface by an X-Road registration officer.

## 2.21 SECURITY_SERVERS

Information about a Security Server registered in this X-Road instance. Security Server always belongs to a particular X-Road member. For Security Server to function properly, it needs at least one authentication certificate. Security Server may have clients (subsystems).

A prerequisite for creating the record is that the authentication certificate registration request for not yet existing Security Server are approved (see also documentation of tables requests and request_processings). The record is created when request is approved by an X-Road registration officer in the user interface. The record is modified when an X-Road registration officer edits Security Server address in the user interface. The record can be deleted in the user interface by an X-Road registration officer.

## 2.22 SERVER_CLIENTS

Join table enabling many-to-many relationship between Security Servers and Security Server clients. In other words, associates Security Servers with its clients.

The record is created when a new client is added to the Security Server. It requires approval of a client registration request (see documentation of tables requests and request_processings for details). An X-Road registration officer can do it in the user interface. The record is deleted when a client of a Security Server is deleted in the user interface by an X-Road registration officer. The record is never modified.

## 2.23 SYSTEM_PARAMETERS

System configuration parameter necessary for proper functioning of Central Server and entire X-Road for that matter. System parameters are stored as key-value pairs. Following is the list of supported system parameters. In an HA setup, the name of the node that initiated a particular insertion, is not significant, except for where stated explicitly.

1. managementServiceProviderClass – Member class part of the identifier pointing to the Security Server client that provides management services. The value can be changed in the user interface.
2. managementServiceProviderCode – Member code part of the identifier pointing to the Security Server client that provides management services. The value can be changed in the user interface.
3. managementServiceProviderSubsystem – Subsystem code part of the identifier pointing to the Security Server client that provides management services. The value can be changed in the user interface.
4. centralServerAddress – the DNS name of this Central Server. The value can be changed in the user interface. In an HA setup, the value is local to each node of the cluster.
5. instanceIdentifier – the instance identifier of this X-Road instance. Must be globally unique. The value is assigned during the initialization of the Central Server in the user interface.
6. authCertRegUrl – URL where Security Servers can send their authentication certificate registration requests. May contain placeholder %{centralServerAddress} which will be replaced with value of the centralServerAddress system parameter.
7. confSignDigestAlgoId  – identifier of the digest algorithm that is used for signing the global configuration. Supported values are 'SHA-512', 'SHA-384' and 'SHA-256'.
8. confHashAlgoUri – URI of the algorithm that is used to hash distributable global configuration files. Supported values are http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha512 and http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256.
9. confSignCertHashAlgoUri – URI of the algorithm that is used to hash global configuration signing certificate. Supported values are http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha512 and http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256.
10. securityServerOwnersGroup – name of the global group where all the members that get ownership of any Security Server are automatically added.
11. confExpireIntervalSeconds – time (in seconds)  during which generated global configuration is considered valid.
12. ocspFreshnessSeconds – time (in seconds) during which Security Servers should consider validity information to be usable. After that time, cached OCSP responses must be discarded. This configuration parameter is distributed to Security Servers as part of global configuration.

Some system parameters can be modified by an X-Road security officer in the user interface. All the system parameters that cannot be changed in the user interface, are assigned default values during the initialization of the Central Server. Later these can only be changed from the database. As these parameters are critical for functioning of entire X-Road instance, these must be modified with extreme care.

## 2.25 UI_USERS

UI user name with its last used locale. Maps possible user interface (UI) user names with locales so that when UI user is logged in next time, the locale it has been used is remembered. If a user with no assigned locale logs in, the first available locale is selected to this user. Later user can change its locale in the user interface.

The record is created when the user is logged in the user interface for the first time. The record is modified when the user logged in changes its locale in the user interface. The record is never deleted.
