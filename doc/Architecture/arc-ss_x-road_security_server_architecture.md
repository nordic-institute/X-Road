## 1 Introduction

This document describes the architecture of the X-Road security server. For more information about X-Road and the role of the security server see \[[ARC-G](#Ref_ARC-G)\].

This document presents an overview of the components of the security server and the interfaces between these components. It is aimed at technical readers who want to acquire an overview of inner workings of the security server.

Only the technical specification of the security server components is provided, for specific examples of interoperability between these components see \[[UC-MESS](#Ref_UC-MESS)\].


### 1.1 Overview

The main function of a security server is to mediate requests between a service client and a service provider. Both the client and the provider communicate with the security server that is connected to their information system and the secure message exchange between the two parties is then handled by the security servers.

-   Messages transmitted over the public Internet are secured using digital signatures and encryption.

-   The service provider's security server applies access control to incoming messages, thus ensuring that only those users that have signed an appropriate agreement with the service provider can access the data.

The security server also depends on a central server, which provides the global configuration.

Technologies used in the security server can be found here: \[[ARC-TEC](#Ref_ARC-TEC)\]

### 2.1 Proxy

The proxy is responsible for mediating messages between service clients and service providers. The messages are transmitted over the public Internet and the proxy ensures that the communication is secured using digital signatures and encryption.

The component is a standalone Java daemon application.


### 2.2 Message Log

Records all regular messages passing through the security server into the database. The messages are stored together with their signatures and signatures are timestamped. The purpose of the message log is to provide means to prove the reception of a request/response message to a third party.

Archives periodically log records from database as signed documents on the disk and purges archived log records from database. By default, all the signed documents on the disk are grouped together, but grouping them by member or subsystem is also supported.

Both the records in the messagelog database and the message archives can be optionally encrypted (opt-in).

Provides a service that allows the retrieval of signed documents (from database) containing the stored information.

The component is a proxy addon.


### 2.3 Metadata Services

Provides methods that can be used by X-Road participants to discover what services are available from the security server.

The component is a proxy addon.


### 2.4 Operational Monitoring Services

Provides methods that can be used by X-Road participants to get operational monitoring information of the security server.
It requests the data from the local opmonitor service via an SOAP XML request and mediates the SOAP XML response to the caller.

The component is a proxy addon.


### 2.5 Opmonitor

Opmonitor component collects operational monitoring information such as which services have been called, how many times, what was the size of the response, etc. 
The monitoring data is published via SOAP XML and (optional) JMX interfaces.

The component is a separate daemon process.

### 2.6 Signer

The signer component is responsible for managing keys and certificates used for signing messages. The signer is called from the proxy component when signing messages or verifying their validity. The user interface also calls the signer when generating authentication and signing keys or certificate requests.

The component is a standalone Java daemon application.


### 2.7 Database

The security server configuration is held in a PostgreSQL\[[1](#Ref_1)\] database. For a detailed description of the security server configuration refer to \[[DM-SS](#Ref_DM-SS)\]. The configuration can be modified through the security server user interface.


<a id="Ref_1" class="anchor"></a>
\[1\] See <http://www.postgresql.org/> for details.


### 2.8 User Interface Frontend

The security server user interface allows a user to manage the security server configuration. 

The user interface is a single page web application that makes requests to the management REST API to read and modify configuration.

The user interface fetches it's resources (images, stylesheets, javascript files) from the web application which
hosts the management REST API.

### 2.9 Management REST API

The management REST API offers endpoints that can be used to read and modify the security server configuration.
These endpoints are used by the user interface frontend, and can be used by standalone API clients.
The management REST API is packaged in an executable Spring Boot\[[2](#Ref_2)\] *jar* archive.
This Spring Boot application starts an embedded Tomcat\[[3](#Ref_3)\] servlet engine, which also serves the resources for the user interface frontend.
Embedded Tomcat listens on a fixed port that is configured in internal configuration files.
In addition, the application listens to incoming \[[ACME](#Ref_ACME)\] challenge requests from the ACME server on port 80.

Management REST API endpoints are documented using an OpenAPI 3 definition: \[[REST_UI-API](#Ref_REST_UI-API)\].
For more information on OpenAPI 3, see \[[OPENAPI](#Ref_OPENAPI)\].


Certain API operations attempt to modify the X-Road global configuration and require management requests to be sent to the X-Road central server. These requests need to be approved by the central server administrator before they are reflected in the global configuration.

User action events that change the system state or configuration are logged into the audit log. The actions are logged regardless of whether the outcome was a success or a failure. The complete list of the audit log events is described in \[[SPEC-AL](#Ref_SPEC-AL)\].

<a id="Ref_2" class="anchor"></a>
\[2\] See <https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot> for details.

<a id="Ref_3" class="anchor"></a>
\[3\] See <http://tomcat.apache.org/> for details.


### 2.10 Configuration Client

The configuration client is responsible for downloading remote global configuration files. The source location of the global configuration is taken from the anchor file that was uploaded from the security server user interface.

The component is a standalone Java daemon application.


### 2.11 Password Store

Stores security token passwords in a shared memory segment of the operating system that can be accessed by the security server interface and signer. Allows security token logins to persist, until the security server is restarted, without compromising the passwords.


### 2.12 SSCD

The SSCD (Secure Signature Creation Device) is an optional hardware component that provides secure cryptographic signature creation capability to the signer.

The SSCD needs to be a PKCS \#11 (see \[[PKCS11](#Ref_PKCS11)\]) compliant hardware device that can be optionally used by the security server for signing messages that it exchanges. The use of the interface requires that a PKCS \#11 compliant device driver is installed and configured in the security server system.


### 2.13 Environmental Monitoring Service

Provides methods that can be used by X-Road participants to get environmental data of the security server. It requests the data from the local monitoring service via gRPC interface and translates it to a SOAP XML response.

The protocol is synchronous RPC style protocol that is initiated by the service client IS.

The interface is described in more detail in \[[ARC-G](#Ref_ARC-G)\], \[[PR-META](#Ref_PR-META)\].


### 4.6 Downloading Signed Documents

The service for downloading signed documents can be used by the information systems to download signed containers from the security server's message log. The containers can be transferred to third parties and verified offline. In addition, the service provides a convenience method for downloading global configuration that can be used to verify the signed containers.

The protocol is a synchronous RPC-style protocol that is initiated by the IS.

The interface is described in more detail in \[[ARC-G](#Ref_ARC-G)\].


### 4.7 TSP

The Time-Stamp Protocol (see \[[TSP](#Ref_TSP)\]) is used by security servers to ensure long-term proof value of the exchanged messages. The security servers log all the messages and their signatures. These logs are periodically time-stamped to create long-term proof.

The Time-Stamp Protocol is a synchronous protocol provided by the timestamp authority.

The interface is described in more detail in \[[ARC-G](#Ref_ARC-G)\].


### 4.8 OCSP

The OCSP protocol (see \[[OCSP](#Ref_OCSP)\]) is used by the security servers to query the validity information about the signing and authentication certificates.

The OCSP protocol is synchronous protocol provided by the OCSP responder belonging to a certification authority.

The interface is described in more detail in \[[ARC-G](#Ref_ARC-G)\].


### 4.9 Operational Monitoring Protocol

The X-Road Operational Monitoring Protocol can be used by the external monitoring systems to gather operational information of the security server. The protocol is synchronous RPC style protocol that is initiated by the external monitoring system.

The protocol is described in more detail in \[[PR-OPMON](#Ref_PR-OPMON)\].


### 4.10 Store Operational Monitoring Data

### 4.13 Environmental Monitoring JMX

Monitor JMX interface publishes local security server environmental monitoring data gathered by environmental monitoring service.


## 5 Deployment View


### 5.1 Simple Deployment

In scenarios where availability is not a critical concern (such as testing environments) a single security server can be used. The authentication and signing keys are stored on a HSM device. [Figure 2](#Ref_Simple_security_server_deployment) shows the corresponding deployment diagram.

<a id="Ref_Simple_security_server_deployment" class="anchor"></a>
![](img/arc-ss_simple_security_server_deployment.svg)

Figure 3. Simple security server deployment

Optionally, an SSCD can be connected with the security server if message signatures are to be provided by a cryptographic hardware device.


### 5.2 Redundant Deployment

The availability of the entire system can be increased with the use of redundancy. The information system can be connected to multiple security servers through a load balancer to evenly distribute the load. If multiple security servers provide the service requested by the service client, then the service client's security server will choose the first available service provider's security server when forwarding the request. Thus, redundancy is inherent to the X-Road message transport protocol, provided that there are multiple security servers configured to offer the same service.
