## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe the management of the
security server including:

-   the management of the graphical user interface;

-   the management of timestamping services,

-   the management of the security server's internal TLS certificate,

-   the management of keys and certificates and

-   the backing up and restoring the security server configuration.

The use cases include verifications that take place, and the main error
conditions that may be encountered during the described process. The
general system errors that may be encountered in most of the use cases
(e.g., database connection errors or out of memory errors) are not
described in this document.

The use cases assume that the X-Road software components involved in the
use cases are installed and initialised (see \[[IG-SS](#Ref_IG-SS)\]).

The use cases including a human actor (the *level* of the use case is
*user task*) assume, that the actor is logged in to the system and has
the access rights required to carry out the use case.

## 2 Overview

Timestamping services are used to preserve the evidence value of the
messages exchanged over the X-Road (see \[UC-MESS\]). The timestamping
services used in a security server must be approved by the X-Road
governing agency.

TLS certificates are used for establishing TLS connections with the
security server client's information systems if the “HTTPS” connection
method is chosen for the client's servers.

Signing certificates are used for signing X-Road messages.
Authentication certificates are used for establishing secure data
exchange channels between the security servers.

Backing up the system configuration ensures that in case of system
failure, the system configuration can be restored to a previously backed
up state.

## 3 Use Case Model

### 3.1 Actors

The X-Road security server management use case model includes the
following actor:

-   **SS administrator** (security server administrator) – a person
    responsible for managing the security server.

-   **Central server** – the central server of the X-Road instance. The
    central server provides management services for the security servers
    of this X-Road instance. The authentication certificate deletion
    requests are forwarded to the central server by the management
    services' security server. The authentication certificate
    registration request is sent directly to the central server by the
    security server that the certificate is to be registered for.

-   **Management services' security server** – a security server that
    has the management services' provider for this X-Road instance
    registered as a security server client.

The relationships between actors, systems and use cases are described in
Figure 1.

    - 2.3 Accept REST API's self-signed SSL certificate
    - 2.4 Provide credentials of an SS administrator with role XROAD_SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR,
    using [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
    - 2.5 Provide roles to link to API key, with message body containing the role names in a JSON array of strings
    - 2.6 Define correct content type with HTTP header `Content-Type: application/json`
    - Example using "curl" command: `curl -X PUT -u <username>:<password> https://localhost:4000/api/v1/api-keys/63 --data '["XROAD_SERVICE_ADMINISTRATOR","XROAD_REGISTRATION_OFFICER"]' --header "Content-Type: application/json" -k`

3.  System updates the API key and responds with a JSON message containing details of the key:
    - 3.1 API key id with name `id`
    - 3.2 Roles linked to key, with name `roles`, in an array of strings
    - Example:

```
{
  "roles": [
    "XROAD_REGISTRATION_OFFICER",
    "XROAD_SERVICE_ADMINISTRATOR"
  ],
  "id": 63
}
```

**Extensions**:

- 1a. SS administrator provides invalid credentials or credentials for a user who does not have XROAD_SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR
  role
    - 1a.1. System responds with HTTP 401 or HTTP 403
- 1b. SS administrator sends request from a remote server
    - 1b.1. System responds with HTTP 403
- 1c. SS administrator tries to update a key that does not exist
    - 1c.1. System responds with HTTP 404

### 3.47 UC SS\_46: Revoke an API key

**System**: Security server

**Level**: User task

**Component:** Security server

**Actors**: SS administrator

**Brief Description**: Administrator revokes an existing API key using a REST API.

**Preconditions**: -

**Postconditions**: -

**Trigger**: SS administrator wants to revoke an API key.

**Main Success Scenario**:

1.  SS administrator sends HTTP DELETE request to delete one API key. REST client should
    - 2.1 Send request locally from the security server, remote access is forbidden (by default)
      - see UG-SYSPAR for how to override this \[[UG-SYSPAR](#Ref_UG-SYSPAR)\]
    - 2.2 Send request to URL `https://localhost:4000/api/v1/api-keys/{id}`,
    where `{id}` is the id of the key to be deleted.
    - 2.3 Accept REST API's self-signed SSL certificate
    - 2.4 Provide credentials of an SS administrator with role XROAD_SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR,
    using [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
    - Example using "curl" command: `curl -X DELETE -u <username>:<password> https://localhost:4000/api/v1/api-keys/63 -k`

2.  System deletes the key and it cannot be used for authentication anymore. System responds with HTTP 200.

**Extensions**:

- 1a. SS administrator provides invalid credentials or credentials for a user who does not have XROAD_SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR
  role
    - 1a.1. System responds with HTTP 401 or HTTP 403
- 1b. SS administrator sends request from a remote server
    - 1b.1. System responds with HTTP 401 (unless remote access is allowed, see \[[UG-SYSPAR](#Ref_UG-SYSPAR)\])
- 1c. SS administrator tries to revoke a key that does not exist
    - 1c.1. System responds with HTTP 404

### 3.48 UC SS\_47: Call a REST API

**System**: Security server

**Level**: User task

**Component:** Security server

**Actors**: SS administrator

**Brief Description**: Administrator performs a configuration action using a REST API.

**Preconditions**: -

**Postconditions**: -

**Trigger**: SS administrator wants to read or update configuration using a REST API.

**Main Success Scenario**:

1.  SS administrator sends a REST request to perform some kind of configuration action. REST client should
    - 2.1 Send request from anywhere, remote access is not forbidden (by default)
      - see UG-SYSPAR for how to override this \[[UG-SYSPAR](#Ref_UG-SYSPAR)\]
    - 2.2 Send request to URL corresponding to the desired action,
     for example `https://<security-server-address>:4000/api/v1/clients` to list clients.
    - 2.3 Use HTTP method corresponding to the desired action,
     for example HTTP GET to list clients.
    - 2.4 Accept REST API's self-signed SSL certificate
    - 2.5 Provide API key (created in [UC SS\_43](#344-uc-ss_43-create-a-new-api-key)) in HTTP header
    `Authorization: X-Road-ApiKey token=<api key>`
    - 2.6 Provide required message, if any, in HTTP body
    - 2.7 Specify correct content type for the body, if any, with HTTP header such as `Content-Type: application/json`
    - Example using "curl" command: `curl --header "Authorization: X-Road-apikey token=<api key>" "https://<security-server-address>:4000/api/v1/clients" -k`

2.  System performs the desired action. System responds with HTTP 200. System returns the results of the operation,
    if any, in HTTP body

**Extensions**:

- 1a. SS administrator provides an invalid or revoked API key
    - 1a.1. System responds with HTTP 401
- 1b. SS administrator provides an API key which is not linked to roles that are required to execute the operation
    - 1b.1. System responds with HTTP 403
- 1c. There is a problem when executing the operation
    - 1c.1. System responds with a HTTP status corresponding to the failure (documented in OpenAPI specification)

The available endpoints, and the details of them, are specified in more detail in OpenAPI specification and
REST API guidelines (TBD). Access rights for different REST API endpoints follow the same rules as the corresponding UI operations.
