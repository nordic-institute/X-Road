## 2 Overview

X-Road services are used by X-Road members communicating directly with each other via security servers, using synchronous request-response messaging pattern.

Security servers periodically download global configuration from the central server (see \[[UC-GCONF](#Ref_UC-GCONF)\]). The global configuration is used to check validity of various data items, such as certificates, OCSP responses and timestamps. In addition, the global configuration is used to verify that communicating parties are registered on the X-Road.

Security servers ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the exchanged messages by signing the messages with the X-Road member's signing key and using mutually authenticated Transport Layer Security (TLS) channel for transport. The long-term evidential value of the signed messages is ensured by logging the exchanged messages and periodically timestamping the message logs.

The security servers interact with trust services to acquire certificate validity information and to timestamp signed messages. The trust service calls are asynchronous with respect to the message exchange.

Security servers store operational monitoring data in operational monitoring buffer and forward the data to operational monitoring daemon (see \[[UC-OPMON](#Ref_UC-OPMON)\]).

The communication process between an X-Road service client and an X-Road service provider is described in detail as use cases in [Chapter 3](#3-use-case-model).

The general steps of the communication process, excluding actions that are asynchronous to the message exchange process, are depicted as a sequence diagram in [Annex A](#annex-a-sequence-diagram-for-messaging).


## 3 Use Case Model


### 3.1 Actors

The X-Road member communication use case model includes the following actors.

-   **Client IS** (service client's information system) – a subsystem of an X-Road member acting as a service client in an X-Road service call event.

-   **Client SS** (service client's security server) – X-Road security server where the service client's information system is registered as a client of this security server.

-   **Provider IS** (service provider's information system) – a subsystem of an X-Road member acting as a service provider in an X-Road service call event.

-   **Provider SS** (service provider's security server) – X-Road security server where the service provider's information system is registered as a client of this security server.

-   **TSS** (timestamping server) – a timestamping service approved by the X-Road and configured to be used by the Client SS and Provider SS.

-   **OCSP responder** – OCSP service providing OCSP responses for the approved certification service that issued the certificates used by the Client SS and Provider SS.

Relationships between actors, systems and use cases are described in [Figure 1](#Ref_Communication_use_case_diagram).

### 3.2 UC MESS\_01: X-Road Service Call

**System**: X-Road

**Level**: Summary

**Component**: Security server

**Actors**:

-   Client IS

-   Client SS

-   Provider SS

-   Provider IS

**Brief Description**: A service client initiates a service call and receives a response. Both the request and the response are processed by the service client's and the service provider's security servers.

**Preconditions**:

-   Service provider and service client are affiliated to the X-Road.

-   Service provider and service client have entered into a service usage contract.

-   Service provider and service client have interfaced their information systems as subsystems to the X-Road system.

-   Service client's security server is running and able to receive messages.

**Postcondition**: Service client's information system has received either a service response or a SOAP Fault message.

**Trigger**: Service client's information system initiates an X-Road service call.

**Main Success Scenario**:

1.  Client IS forms and sends an X-Road SOAP request to the Client SS.

2.  Client SS processes the X-Road SOAP request and forwards the request as X-Road request message to the Provider SS: [3.3](#33-uc-mess_02-process-x-road-soap-request) (steps 1-14).

3.  Provider SS processes the X-Road request message and forwards the request as X-Road SOAP request to the Provider IS: [3.4](#34-uc-mess_03-process-x-road-request-message) (steps 1-14).

4.  Provider IS processes the received request, forms an X-Road SOAP response and sends the response to Provider SS.

5.  Provider SS processes the X-Road SOAP response and forwards the response as X-Road response message to the Client SS: [3.4](#34-uc-mess_03-process-x-road-request-message) (steps 15-20).

6.  Client SS processes the X-Road response message and forwards the response as X-Road SOAP response to the Client IS: [3.3](#33-uc-mess_02-process-x-road-soap-request) (steps 15-22).

7.  Client IS receives and processes the response.

**Extensions**:

2-6a. Processing or forwarding the message results in an error. Client IS receives a SOAP Fault message. The use case terminates.

**Related information**:

-   X-Road SOAP messages must conform to the profile described in document “X-Road: Message Protocol” \[[PR-MESS](#Ref_PR-MESS)\].

-   Messaging between security servers conforms to the protocol described in document “X-Road: Message Transport Protocol” \[[PR-MESSTRANSP](#Ref_PR-MESSTRANSP)\].


### 3.3 UC MESS\_02: Process X-Road SOAP Request

**System**: Service client's security server

**Level**: System

**Component**: Security server

**Actors**:

-   Client IS

-   Provider SS

**Brief Description**: The system receives a request message from Client IS; verifies that the system configuration allows X-Road message exchange and that the request message composition conforms to the X-Road message protocol; sets up a secure connection session with the Provider SS; signs the request message; logs the request message and the signature; sends the request message and signature to Provider SS and awaits for the response. After receiving the response from Provider SS, system validates the response composition and signature; logs the response message and signature and sends the response to the Client IS. In case a verification or a validation fails or when the system encounters an error condition, the system sends an error (SOAP Fault) message to the Client IS.

**Preconditions**:

-   Service client's security server is running and able to receive messages.

**Postconditions**: -

**Trigger**: Client IS sends a request to the system.

**Main Success Scenario**:

1.  System receives the request and verifies that the request was sent using POST method.

2.  System verifies that the system configuration contains valid global configuration.

3.  System verifies that the system configuration contains an authentication certificate that can be used for exchanging messages with another security server (the certificate must be active and valid).

4.  System verifies that the request contains a SOAP message and verifies the SOAP message: [3.5](#35-uc-mess_04-verify-soap-message).

5.  System verifies that SOAP request header contains X-Road service identifier.

6.  System verifies that the Client IS is in *Registered* state in the system configuration.

7.  System verifies that the communication type for the Client IS in the system configuration is set to “HTTPS” and that the Client IS has made the connection for sending the request using HTTPS protocol.

8.  System verifies that the Client IS provided a TLS certificate that matches a certificate saved for the Client IS in the system configuration.

9.  System looks up Provider SS addresses from the global configuration.

10. System prepares the authentication information that will be sent to the Provider SS while setting up a secure connection.

11. System verifies that no cached communication sessions with the found addresses exist and initiates a secure connection with the fastest responder: [3.6](#36-uc-mess_05-initiate-a-secure-connection).

12. System signs the request message: [3.9](#39-uc-mess_08-create-signature).

13. System logs the request message and signature to the message log: [3.10](#310-uc-mess_09-log-message-and-signature-to-message-log).

14. System sends the signed request and OCSP responses needed to verify the authentication certificate to the Provider SS and waits for the response.

15. System receives a response from the Provider SS and parses the response to verify that the message parts are well-formed.

16. System verifies that the response is not a SOAP Fault message.

17. System verifies that the response contains a SOAP message and a signature.

18. System verifies the signature: [3.12](#312-uc-mess_11-verify-signature).

19. System verifies that the SOAP response headers are consistent with the SOAP request headers.
