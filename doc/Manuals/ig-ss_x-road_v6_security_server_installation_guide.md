### 2.3 Requirements for the Security Server

Minimum recommended hardware parameters:

-   the server’s hardware (motherboard, CPU, network interface cards, storage system) must be supported by Ubuntu in general;

-   a 64-bit dual-core Intel, AMD or compatible CPU; AES instruction set support is highly recommended;

-   3 GB RAM;

-   a 100 Mbps network interface card;

-   if necessary, interfaces for the use of hardware tokens.

Requirements to software and settings:

-   an installed and configured Ubuntu 14.04 or 18.04 LTS x86-64 operating system;

-   if the security server is separated from other networks by a firewall and/or NAT, the necessary connections to and from the security server are allowed (**reference data: 1.4; 1.5; 1.6; 1.7**). The enabling of auxiliary services which are necessary for the functioning and management of the operating system (such as DNS, NTP, and SSH) stay outside the scope of this guide;

-   if the security server has a private IP address, a corresponding NAT record must be created in the firewall (**reference data: 1.9**).


### 2.4 Preparing OS

-   Add system user (**reference data: 1.3**) whom all roles in the user interface are granted to. Add a new user with the command

        sudo adduser <username>

    User roles are discussed in detail in X-Road Security Server User Guide \[[UG-SS](#Ref_UG-SS)\].

-   Set the operating system locale. Add following line to the `/etc/environment` file.

        LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

-   Ensure that the locale is available

        sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8


### 2.5 Installation

To install the X-Road security server software on *Ubuntu* operating system, follow these steps.

1.  Add the X-Road repository’s signing key to the list of trusted keys (**reference data: 1.2**):

        curl https://artifactory.niis.org/api/gpg/key/public | sudo apt-key add -

2.  Add X-Road package repository (**reference data: 1.1**)

        sudo apt-add-repository -y "deb https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-release-deb $(lsb_release -sc)-current main"

    Add nginx repository

        sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:ondrej/nginx

    *Only Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty)*: Add OpenJDK repository

        sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:openjdk-r/ppa

3.  Issue the following commands to install the security server packages (use package xroad-securityserver-ee to include configuration specific to Estonia; use package xroad-securityserver-fi to include configuration specific to Finland):

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install xroad-securityserver

Upon the first installation of the packages, the system asks for the following information.

-   Account name for the user who will be granted the rights to perform all activities in the user interface (**reference data: 1.3**).

-   The Distinguished Name of the owner of the **user interface’s** self-signed TLS certificate (*Subject DN*) and its alternative names (*subjectAltName*) (**reference data: 1.8; 1.10**). The certificate is used for securing connections to the user interface.
    The name and IP addresses detected from the operating system are suggested as default values.

    -   The *Subject DN* must be entered in the format:

            /CN=server.domain.tld

    -   All IP addresses and domain names in use must be entered as alternative names in the format:

            IP:1.2.3.4,IP:4.3.2.1,DNS:servername,DNS:servername2.domain.tld

-   The Distinguished Name of the owner of the TLS certificate that is used for securing the HTTPS access point of information systems (**reference data: 1.8; 1.11**).
    The name and IP addresses detected from the system are suggested as default values.

    -   The *Subject DN* must be entered in the format:

            /CN=server.domain.tld

    -   All IP addresses and domain names in use must be entered as alternative names in the format:

            IP:1.2.3.4,IP:4.3.2.1,DNS:servername,DNS:servername2.domain.tld

The meta-package `xroad-securityserver` also installs metaservices module `xroad-addon-metaservices`, messagelog module `xroad-addon-messagelog` and WSDL validator module `xroad-addon-wsdlvalidator`. The meta-package `xroad-securityserver-ee` installs operational data monitoring module `xroad-addon-opmonitoring`.


### 2.6 Post-Installation Checks

The installation is successful if system services are started and the user interface is responding.

-   Ensure from the command line that X-Road services are in the `running` state (example output follows):

    - Ubuntu 14.04
        ```
        sudo initctl list | grep "^xroad-"

        xroad-jetty start/running, process 19796
        xroad-confclient start/running, process 19563
        xroad-signer start/running, process 19393
        xroad-monitor start/running, process 20669
        xroad-proxy start/running, process 19580
        ```

    - Ubuntu 18.04
        ```
        sudo systemctl list-units "xroad*"

        UNIT                     LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION
        xroad-confclient.service loaded active running X-Road confclient
        xroad-jetty.service      loaded active running X-Road Jetty server
        xroad-monitor.service    loaded active running X-Road Monitor
        xroad-proxy.service      loaded active running X-Road Proxy
        xroad-signer.service     loaded active running X-Road signer
        ```

-   Ensure that the security server user interface at https://SECURITYSERVER:4000/ (**reference data: 1.8; 1.6**) can be opened in a Web browser. To log in, use the account name chosen during the installation (**reference data: 1.3**). While the user interface is still starting up, the Web browser may display the “502 Bad Gateway” error.


### 2.7 Installing the Support for Hardware Tokens

To configure support for hardware security tokens (smartcard, USB token, Hardware Security Module), act as follows.

1.  Install the hardware token support module using the following command:

        sudo apt-get install xroad-addon-hwtokens

2.  Install and configure a PKCS\#11 driver for the hardware token according to the manufacturer's instructions.

3.  Add the path to the PKCS\#11 driver to the file `/etc/xroad/devices.ini` (as described in the example given in the file).

4.  After installing and configuring the driver, the `xroad-signer` service must be restarted:

        sudo service xroad-signer restart

If you are running a high availability (HA) hardware token setup (such as a cluster with replicated tokens) then you may need to constrain the token identifier format such that the token replicas can be seen as the same token. The token identifier format can be changed in `/etc/xroad/devices.ini` via the `token_id_format` property (default value: `{moduleType}{slotIndex}{serialNumber}{label}`). Removing certain parts of the identifier will allow the HA setup to work correctly when one of the tokens goes down and is replaced by a replica. For example, if the token replicas are reported to be on different slots the `{slotIndex}` part should be removed from the identifier format.

Depending on the hardware token there may be a need for more additional configuration. All possible configurable parameters in the `/etc/xroad/devices.ini` are described in the next table.

Parameter   | Type    | Default Value | Explanation
----------- | ------- |-------------- | ---------------------------------------
*enabled*     | BOOLEAN | *true* | Indicates whether this device is enabled.
*library*     | STRING  |      | The path to the pkcs#11 library of the device driver.
*library_cant_create_os_threads* | BOOLEAN | *false* | Indicates whether application threads, which are executing calls to the pkcs#11 library, may not use native operating system calls to spawn new threads (in other words, the library’s code may not create its own threads). 
*os_locking_ok* | BOOLEAN | *false* | Indicates whether the pkcs#11 library may use the native operation system threading model for locking.
*sign_verify_pin* | BOOLEAN | *false* | Indicates whether the PIN should be entered per signing operation.
*token_id_format* | STRING | *{moduleType}{slotIndex}{serialNumber}{label}* | Specifies the identifier format used to uniquely identify a token. In certain high availability setups may need be constrained to support replicated tokens (eg. by removing the slot index part which may be diffirent for the token replicas).
*sign_mechanism*  | STRING | *CKM_RSA_PKCS* | Specifies the signing mechanism. Supported values: *CKM_RSA_PKCS*, *CKM_RSA_PKCS_PSS*.
*pub_key_attribute_encrypt*  | BOOLEAN | *true* | Indicates whether public key can be used for encryption.
*pub_key_attribute_verify* | BOOLEAN | *true* | Indicates whether public key can be used for verification.
*pub_key_attribute_wrap* | BOOLEAN | | Indicates whether public key can be used for wrapping other keys.
*pub_key_attribute_allowed_mechanisms* | STRING LIST | | Specifies public key allowed mechanisms. Supported values: *CKM_RSA_PKCS*, *CKM_SHA256_RSA_PKCS*, *CKM_SHA384_RSA_PKCS*, *CKM_SHA512_RSA_PKCS*, and *CKM_RSA_PKCS_PSS*, *CKM_SHA256_RSA_PKCS_PSS*, *CKM_SHA384_RSA_PKCS_PSS*, *CKM_SHA512_RSA_PKCS_PSS*.
*priv_key_attribute_sensitive* | BOOLEAN | *true* | Indicates whether private key is sensitive.
*priv_key_attribute_decrypt* | BOOLEAN | *true* | Indicates whether private key can be used for encryption.
*priv_key_attribute_sign* | BOOLEAN | *true* | Indicates whether private key can be used for signing.
*priv_key_attribute_unwrap* | BOOLEAN | | Indicates whether private key can be used for unwrapping wrapped keys.
*priv_key_attribute_allowed_mechanisms* | STRING LIST | | Specifies private key allowed mechanisms. Supported values: *CKM_RSA_PKCS*, *CKM_SHA256_RSA_PKCS*, *CKM_SHA384_RSA_PKCS*, *CKM_SHA512_RSA_PKCS*, and *CKM_RSA_PKCS_PSS*, *CKM_SHA256_RSA_PKCS_PSS*, *CKM_SHA384_RSA_PKCS_PSS*, *CKM_SHA512_RSA_PKCS_PSS*.

**Note 1:** Only parameter *library* is mandatory, all the others are optional.  
**Note 2:** The item separator of the type STRING LIST is ",".


### 2.8 Installing the Support for Environmental Monitoring

The support for environmental monitoring functionality on a security server is provided by package xroad-monitor that is installed by default. The package installs and starts the `xroad-monitor` process that will gather and make available the monitoring information.


## 3 Security Server Initial Configuration

During the security server initial configuration, the server’s X-Road membership information and the software token’s PIN are set.


### 3.1 Prerequisites

Configuring the security server assumes that the security server owner is a member of the X-Road.


### 3.2 Reference Data

ATTENTION: Reference items 2.1 - 2.3 in the reference data are provided to the security server owner by the X-Road central’s administrator.

The security server code and the software token’s PIN will be determined during the installation at the latest, by the person performing the installation.

 Ref  |                                                   | Explanation
 ---- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------
 2.1  | &lt;global configuration anchor file&gt; or &lt;URL&gt; | Global configuration anchor file
 2.2  | E.g.<br>GOV - government<br> COM - commercial     | Member class of the security server's owner
 2.3  | &lt;security server owner register code&gt;       | Member code of the security server's owner
 2.4  | &lt;choose security server identificator name&gt; | Security server's code
 2.5  | &lt;choose PIN for software token&gt;             | Software token’s PIN


### 3.3 Configuration

To perform the initial configuration, open the address

    https://SECURITYSERVER:4000/

in a Web browser (**reference data: 1.8; 1.6**). To log in, use the account name chosen during the installation (**reference data: 1.3).**

Upon first log-in, the system asks for the following information.

-   The global configuration anchor file (**reference data: 2.1**).

    **Please verify anchor hash value with the published value.**

If the configuration is successfully downloaded, the system asks for the following information.

-   The security server owner’s member class (**reference data: 2.2**).

-   The security server owner’s member code (**reference data: 2.3**).
    If the member class and member code are correctly entered, the system displays the security server owner’s name as registered in the X-Road center.

-   Security server code (**reference data: 2.4**), which is chosen by the security server administrator and which has to be unique across all the security servers belonging to the same X-Road member.

-   Software token’s PIN (**reference data: 2.5**). The PIN will be used to protect the keys stored in the software token. The PIN must be stored in a secure place, because it will be no longer possible to use or recover the private keys in the token once the PIN has been lost.


## 4 Installation Error handling


### 4.1 Cannot Set LC\_ALL to Default Locale

If running the locale command results in the error message

    locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory,

then the support for this particular language has not been installed. To install it, run the command (the example uses the English language):

    sudo apt-get install language-pack-en

Then, to update the system’s locale files, run the following commands (the example uses the US locale):

    sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
    sudo update-locale en_US.UTF-8

Set operating system locale. Add following line to `/etc/environment` file:

    LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

After updating the system’s locale settings, it is recommended to restart the operating system.


### 4.2 PostgreSQL Is Not UTF8 Compatible

If the security server installation is aborted with the error message

    postgreSQL is not UTF8 compatible,

then the PostgreSQL package is installed with a wrong locale. One way to resolve it is to remove the data store created upon the PostgreSQL installation and recreate it with the correct encoding.

**WARNING**: All data in the database will be erased!

    sudo pg_dropcluster --stop 9.3 main
    LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8" sudo pg_createcluster --start 9.3 main

To complete the interrupted installation, run the command

    sudo apt-get -f install


### 4.3 Could Not Create Default Cluster

If the following error message is displayed during PostgreSQL installation:

    Error: The locale requested by the environment is invalid.
    Error: could not create default cluster. Please create it manually with pg_createcluster 9.3 main –start,

use the following command to create the PostgreSQL data cluster:

    LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8" sudo pg_createcluster --start 9.3 main

The interrupted installation can be finished using

    sudo apt-get -f install


### 4.4 Is Postgres Running On Port 5432?

If the following error message appears during installation

    Is postgres running on port 5432 ?
    Aborting installation! please fix issues and rerun with apt-get -f install,

check if any of the following errors occurred during the installation of PostgreSQL.

-   Error installing the data cluster. Refer to section [“Could not create default cluster”](#43-could-not-create-default-cluster).

-   The PostgreSQL data cluster installed during the installation of the security server is not configured to listen on port 5432. To verify and configure the listening port, edit the PostgreSQL configuration file in `/etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgresql.conf`. If you change the listening port, the postgresql service must be restarted.

The interrupted installation can be finished using

    sudo apt-get -f install


### 4.5 Different versions of xroad-\* packages after successful upgrade

Sometimes, after using `sudo apt-get upgrade` command, some of the packages are not upgraded. In the following example `xroad-securityserver` package version is still 6.8.3 although other packages are upgraded to 6.8.5:

    # sudo dpkg -l | grep xroad-
    ii xroad-addon-messagelog 6.8.5.20160929134539gitfe60f90
    ii xroad-addon-metaservices 6.8.5.20160929134539gitfe60f90
    ii xroad-addon-wsdlvalidator 6.8.5.20160929134539gitfe60f90
    ii xroad-common 6.8.5.20160929134539gitfe60f90
    ii xroad-jetty9 6.8.5.20160929134539gitfe60f90
    ii xroad-proxy 6.8.5.20160929134539gitfe60f90
    ii xroad-securityserver 6.8.3-3-201605131138

`apt-get upgrade` command doesn’t install new packages - in this particular case new packages `xroad-monitor` and `xroad-addon-proxymonitor` installation is needed for upgrade of `xroad-securityserver` package.

To be sure that packages are installed correctly please use `sudo apt upgrade` or `sudo apt full-upgrade` commands.
