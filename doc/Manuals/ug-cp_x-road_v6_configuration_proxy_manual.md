## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Target Audience

The intended audience of this Manual are X-Road system administrators responsible for installing and using X-Road configuration proxy software.

The document is intended for readers with a moderate knowledge of Linux server management, computer networks, and the X-Road working principles.

### 1.2 Terms and abbreviations

See X-Road terms and abbreviations documentation \[[TA-TERMS](#Ref_TERMS)\].

### 1.3 References

1. <a id="Ref_TERMS" class="anchor"></a>\[TA-TERMS\] X-Road Terms and Abbreviations. Document ID: [TA-TERMS](../terms_x-road_docs.md).

### 1.4 X-Road Configuration Proxy

The configuration proxy acts as an intermediary between X-Road servers in the matters of global configuration exchange.

The goal of the configuration proxy is to download an X-Road global configuration from a provided configuration source and further distribute it in a secure way. Optionally, the downloaded global configuration may be modified to suit the requirements of the configuration proxy owner.

The configuration proxy can be configured to mediate several global configurations (from multiple configuration sources).


## 2 Installation

### 2.1 Supported Platforms

The configuration proxy runs on the Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS operating system on a 64-bit platform. The configuration proxy's software is distributed as .deb packages through the official X-Road repository at [https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-release-deb](https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-release-deb).

The software can be installed both on physical and virtualized hardware (of the latter, Xen and Oracle VirtualBox have been tested).


### 2.2 Reference Data

**Note:** The information in empty cells has to be determined before the server’s installation, by the person performing the installation.

**Caution:** Data necessary for the functioning of the operating system is not included.

### 2.3 Requirements for the Configuration Proxy

Minimum recommended hardware parameters:

* the server’s hardware (motherboard, CPU, network interface cards, storage system) must be supported by Ubuntu in general;
* a 64-bit dual-core Intel, AMD or compatible CPU; AES instruction set support is highly recommended;
* 2 GB RAM;
* a 100 Mbps network interface card;
* if necessary, interfaces for the use of hardware tokens.

Requirements to software and settings:

* an installed and configured supported version of Ubuntu x86-64 operating system;
* if the configuration proxy is separated from other networks by a firewall and/or NAT, the necessary connections to and from the security server must be allowed (reference data: 1.3; 1.4). The enabling of auxiliary services which are necessary for the functioning and management of the operating system (such as DNS, NTP, and SSH) is outside the scope of this guide;
* if the configuration proxy has a private IP address, a corresponding NAT record must be created in the firewall (reference data: 1.5).


### 2.4 Preparing OS

- Set the operating system locale.

  Add the following line to the file /etc/environment: `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`  
  Ensure that the locale is generated: `sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8`

### 2.5 Installation

To install the X-Road configuration proxy software, follow these steps.

1.  Add the X-Road repository’s signing key to the list of trusted keys (**reference data: 1.2**):

        curl https://artifactory.niis.org/api/gpg/key/public | sudo apt-key add -

2.  Add X-Road package repository (**reference data: 1.1**)

        sudo apt-add-repository -y "deb https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-release-deb $(lsb_release -sc)-current main"

3.  Issue the following commands to install the configuration proxy packages:

            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install xroad-confproxy

### 2.6 Post-Installation Checks

The installation is successful if the 'xroad-signer' service is started, the 'xroad-confproxy' cron job is added, and the configuration proxy management utilities are available from the command line.

* Check from the command line that the 'xroad-signer' service is in the running state (example output follows). Notice that it is normal for the xroad-confclient to be in `stopped` state on the configuration proxy since it operates in one-shot mode.

  * Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04
    ```bash
    systemctl list-units "xroad*" 

    UNIT                     LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION
    xroad-signer.service     loaded active running X-Road signer
    ```

* Check from the command line that the 'xroad-confproxy' cron job is present (example output follows):

  ```bash
  sudo ls /etc/cron.d/ | grep "^xroad-"
 
  xroad-confproxy
  ```

* Make sure that the following commands are available from the command line:

  ```bash
  signer-console
  confproxy-view-conf
  confproxy-create-instance
  confproxy-add-signing-key
  confproxy-del-signing-key
  confproxy-generate-anchor
  ```

### 2.7 Installing the Support for Hardware Tokens

To configure support for hardware security tokens (smartcard, USB token, Hardware Security Module), act as follows.

1.  Install the hardware token support module using the following command:

        sudo apt-get install xroad-addon-hwtokens

2.  Install and configure a PKCS\#11 driver for the hardware token according to the manufacturer's instructions.

3.  Add the path to the PKCS\#11 driver to the file `/etc/xroad/devices.ini` (as described in the example given in the file).

4.  After installing and configuring the driver, the `xroad-signer` service must be restarted:

        sudo service xroad-signer restart

If you are running a high availability (HA) hardware token setup (such as a cluster with replicated tokens) then you may need to constrain the token identifier format such that the token replicas can be seen as the same token. The token identifier format can be changed in `/etc/xroad/devices.ini` via the `token_id_format` property (default value: `{moduleType}{slotIndex}{serialNumber}{label}`). Removing certain parts of the identifier will allow the HA setup to work correctly when one of the tokens goes down and is replaced by a replica. For example, if the token replicas are reported to be on different slots the `{slotIndex}` part should be removed from the identifier format.

Depending on the hardware token there may be a need for more additional configuration. All possible configurable parameters in the `/etc/xroad/devices.ini` are described in the next table.

Parameter   | Type    | Default Value | Explanation
----------- | ------- |-------------- | ---------------------------------------
*enabled*     | BOOLEAN | *true* | Indicates whether this device is enabled.
*library*     | STRING  |      | The path to the pkcs#11 library of the device driver.
*library_cant_create_os_threads* | BOOLEAN | *false* | Indicates whether application threads, which are executing calls to the pkcs#11 library, may not use native operating system calls to spawn new threads (in other words, the library’s code may not create its own threads).
*os_locking_ok* | BOOLEAN | *false* | Indicates whether the pkcs#11 library may use the native operation system threading model for locking.
*sign_verify_pin* | BOOLEAN | *false* | Indicates whether the PIN should be entered per signing operation.

### 2.8 Configuring TLS Certificates

The installation process creates a self-signed TLS certificate for serving configurations over HTTPS. However, self-signed certificates are not recommended for production use, and should be substituted with certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

To configure the configuration proxy to use a certificate issued by a trusted CA, replace the existing certificate files (`confproxy.crt`) and its associated private key (`confproxy.key`), located in the `/etc/xroad/ssl/` directory.

Reload the nginx service for the certificate change to take effect.

```bash
systemctl reload nginx
```

## 3 Configuration

To start using the configuration proxy, a proxy instance configuration needs to be created. Several proxy instances can be configured to mediate multiple global configurations.


### 3.1 Prerequisites

#### 3.1.1 Security Token Activation

The configuration proxy uses a security token for storing the key that is used for signing the distributed configuration. The token can be stored either on hard disk (software token) or in hardware. Before the configuration proxy can be used, the security token must be initialized and activated.

Initialization of a software token can be done as follows:

```bash
signer-console init-software-token
```

A PIN is prompted, which will be used to log in to the software token afterwards. Initialization of hardware tokens is vendorspecific and is not in scope of this documentation.

Activation of the security token is done by logging in to the token, using the following command:

```bash
signer-console login-token <TOKEN_ID>
```

where &lt;TOKEN_ID&gt; is the identifier of the security token, which can be found with:

```bash
signer-console list-tokens
```

Note, that the identifier of a software token is always „0”.


#### 3.1.2 User Access Privileges

The administrator must execute configuration scripts as the 'xroad' user.


### 3.2 General Configuration

Modify '/etc/xroad/conf.d/local.ini' to contain the following:

```ini
[configuration-proxy]

; Address of the webserver serving the distributed configuration
; address=<public or NAT address>
```

The configuration of this parameter is necessary for generating a correctly formatted configuration anchor file that will need to be uploaded to central servers that should receive configurations mediated by this proxy, this process is described in detail in [3.4](#34-proxy-instance-configuration). There are several more system parameters that can be configured in '/etc/xroad/conf.d/local.ini' under the 'configuration-proxy' section, their descriptions and default values can be seen from the following table:

| Parameter              | Default value                          | Explanation |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| address                | 0.0.0.0                                | The public IP or NAT address (reference data: 1.5) which can be accessed for downloading the distributed global configurations. |
| configuration-path     | /etc/xroad/confproxy/                  | Absolute path to the directory containing the configuration files of the proxy instance. The format of the configuration directory is described in [3.2.1](#321-configuration-structure-of-the-instances). |
| generated-conf-path    | /var/lib/xroad/public                  | Absolute path to the public web server directory where the global configuration files generated by this configuration proxy, should be placed for distribution. |
| signature-digest-algorithm-id | SHA-512                         | ID of the digest algorithm the configuration proxy should use when computing global configuration signatures. The possible values are: *SHA-256*, *SHA-384*, *SHA-512*. |
| hash-algorithm-uri     | http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha512 | URI identifying the algorithm the configuration proxy should use to calculate hash values for the global configuration file. The possible values are:<br>http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256,<br>http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha512. |
| download-script        | /usr/share/xroad/scripts/download_instance_configuration.sh | Absolute path to the location of the script that initializes the global configuration download procedure. |

The configuration proxy is periodically started by a cron job. It reads the properties described above, from the configuration file before executing each proxy instance configured in 'configuration-path', generating new global configuration directories using algorithms as defined by 'signature-digest-algorithm-id' and 'hash-algorithm-uri'. The generated directories are subsequently placed in 'generated-conf-path' for distribution.


#### 3.2.1 Configuration Structure of the Instances

Each global configuration that is to be mediated by the configuration proxy requires a proxy instance to be configured. The configuration of a proxy instance consists of a set of configuration files, including

* a trusted anchor .xml of the configuration being mediated;
* a configuration .ini file;
* verification certificates for the configured signing keys.

The following example file tree shows configured proxy instances named PROXY1 and PROXY2:

```bash
<configuration-path>/
|-PROXY1/
| |-cert_QWERTY123.pem
| |-cert_321YTREWQ.pem
| |-conf.ini
| \-anchor.xml
|-PROXY2/
| |-cert_1234567890.pem
| |-conf.ini
| \-anchor.xml
\-...
```

The configuration of proxy instances is described in [3.4](#34-proxy-instance-configuration).


### 3.3 Proxy Instance Reference Data

**ATTENTION:** The names in the angle brackets&lt;&gt; are chosen by the X-Road configuration proxy administrator.

| Ref |                            | Explanation |
|-----|----------------------------|-------------|
| 2.1 |  &lt;PROXY_NAME&gt;        | Name of the proxy instance being configured |
| 2.2 |  &lt;SECURITY_TOKEN_ID&gt; | ID of a security token (as defined by prerequisites [3.1](#31-prerequisites)) |
| 2.3 |  &lt;ANCHOR_FILENAME&gt;   | Filename of the generated anchor .xml file that the configuration proxy clients will need to use for downloading the global configuration |


### 3.4 Proxy Instance Configuration

1)  Create configuration files for the new proxy instance by invoking the 'confproxy-create-instance -p &lt;PROXY_NAME&gt;' command. Afterwards, use the 'confproxy-view-conf -p &lt;PROXY_NAME&gt;' command to verify that the operation has been successfully completed (example output follows):

```bash
confproxy-create-instance -p PROXY

Populating 'conf.ini' with default values.
Done.

confproxy-view-conf -p PROXY

Configuration for proxy 'PROXY'
Validity interval: 600 s.
anchor.xml
================================================
'anchor.xml' could not be loaded: IOError: /etc/xroad/confproxy/PROXY/anchor.xml (No such file or directory)
Configuration URLs
================================================
http://1.2.3.4/PROXY/conf
https://1.2.3.4/PROXY/conf
Signing keys and certificates
================================================
active-signing-key-id:
    NOT CONFIGURED (add 'active-signing-key-id' to 'conf.ini')
```

2) Generate a signing key and a self signed certificate for the newly created proxy instance using the following command:

```bash
confproxy-add-signing-key -p <PROXY_NAME> -t <SECURITY_TOKEN_ID>
```

If no active signing key is configured for the proxy instance, then the new key should be set as the currently active key (example output follows):

```bash
confproxy-add-signing-key -p PROXY -t 0

Generated key with ID QWERTY123
No active key configured, setting new key as active in conf.ini
Saved self-signed certificate to cert_QWERTY123.pem
confproxy-view-conf -p PROXY
...
Signing keys and certificates
================================================
active-signing-key-id:
QWERTY123 (Certificate: /etc/xroad/confproxy/PROXY/cert_QWERTY123.pem)
```
Alternatively, one may add an existing key using the '–k &lt;KEY_ID&gt;' argument:

```bash
confproxy-add-signing-key -p PROXY -k QWERTY123

No active key configured, setting new key as active in conf.ini
Saved self-signed certificate to cert_QWERTY123.pem
```

3) To define which global configuration this proxy instance should distribute, download the source anchor from an X-Road central server and save it as '/etc/xroad/confproxy/&lt;PROXY_NAME&gt;/anchor.xml'.

4) The configuration proxy should be operational at this point. The periodic cron job (once a minute) should download the global configuration defined in '/etc/xroad/confproxy/&lt;PROXY_NAME&gt;/anchor.xml' and generate a directory for distribution. The output of 'confproxy-view-conf -p &lt;PROXY_NAME&gt;' should be similar to the following:

```bash
confproxy-view-conf -p PROXY

Configuration for proxy 'PROXY'
Validity interval: 600 s.
anchor.xml
================================================
Instance identifier: AA
Generated at: UTC 2014-11-17 09:28:56
Hash: 3A:3D:B2:A4:D3:FC:E8:08:7E:EA:8A:92:5C:6E:92:0C:70:C8
Configuration URLs
================================================
http://1.2.3.4/PROXY/conf
https://1.2.3.4/PROXY/conf
Signing keys and certificates
================================================
active-signing-key-id:
QWERTY123 (Certificate: /etc/xroad/confproxy/PROXY/cert_QWERTY123.pem)
```

5) To let clients download the generated global configuration an anchor file needs to be generated using the following command:

```bash
confproxy-generate-anchor -p <PROXY_NAME> -f <ANCHOR_FILENAME>
```

If generation was successful the output should be simply:

```bash
confproxy-generate-anchor -p PROXY -f /home/xroad/anchor.xml

Generated anchor xml to '/home/xroad/anchor.xml'
```

6) To make sure that the global configuration is being distributed correctly use the '/usr/share/xroad/scripts/download_instance_configuration.sh' script, giving it &lt;ANCHOR_FILENAME&gt; and the path, which should hold the downloaded files, as arguments (example output follows):

```bash
mkdir test_download
/usr/share/xroad/scripts/download_instance_configuration.sh anchor.xml test_download/

... - Downloading configuration from http://1.2.3.4/PROXY/conf
... - Downloading content from http://1.2.3.4/PROXY/123/AA/shared-params.xml
... - Saving SHARED-PARAMETERS to test_download/AA/shared-params.xml
... - Saving content to file test_download/AA/shared-params.xml
... - Downloading content from http://1.2.3.4/PROXY/123/AA/private-params.xml
... - Saving PRIVATE-PARAMETERS to test_download/AA/private-params.xml
... - Saving content to file test_download/AA/private-params.xml
```
If the proxy instance has been configured correctly, the 'test_download' directory should contain the downloaded global configuration files.


### 3.5 Additional Configuration

#### 3.5.1 Changing the Validity Interval

There is an additional property in the configuration file of the proxy instance (/etc/xroad/confproxy/&lt;PROXY_NAME&gt;/conf.ini) that determines the validity interval of the generated global configuration for a given instance.

The default value is 10 minutes (600 seconds). The property is set by modifying the following field in the configuration file:

```ini
[configuration-proxy]
...
validity-interval-seconds=600
```

Notice that when the configuration proxy instance is started, it deletes all the previously generated global configuration directories that are older than the currently configured validity interval for that instance.


#### 3.5.2 Deleting the Signing Keys

Should a signing key need to be deleted, the following command can be used:

```bash
confproxy-del-signing-key -p <PROXY_NAME> -k <SIGNING_KEY_ID>
```

where &lt;SIGNING_KEY_ID&gt; can be found in the output of 'confproxy-view-conf' (example output follows):

```bash
confproxy-del-signing-key -p PROXY -k QWERTY123

Deleted key from signer
Deleted key from conf.ini
Deleted self-signed certificate 'cert_QWERTY123.pem'
```

Attempts to delete the active signing key will be unsuccessful.


#### 3.5.3 Changing the Active Signing Key

Additional signing keys can be added with the following command:

```bash
confproxy-add-signing-key -p <PROXY_NAME> -t <SECURITY_TOKEN_ID>
```

Keys added in this manner will be marked as inactive keys ('signing-key-id-\*=&lt;KEY_ID&gt;') in the proxy instance configuration file (/etc/xroad/confproxy/&lt;PROXY_NAME&gt;/conf.ini). In case the current active signing key has to be replaced by one of the additional keys, the configuration file of the proxy instance will need to be modified, changing the following lines:

```ini
[configuration-proxy]
...
active-signing-key-id=QWERTY123
signing-key-id-1=QWERTY123
signing-key-id-2=321YTREWQ
```

to the following ones:

```ini
[configuration-proxy]
...
active-signing-key-id=321YTREWQ
signing-key-id-1=QWERTY123
signing-key-id-2=321YTREWQ
```

After the change the key 'QWERTY123' may be deleted if necessary.
