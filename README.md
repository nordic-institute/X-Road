**What is X-Road?**

X-Road, the data exchange layer for information systems, is a technological and organizational environment enabling a secure Internet-based data exchange between information systems.

![X-Road overview](X-Road_overview.png)

X-Road Data Exchange Layer is a standardised, cohesive, collaborative, interoperable and secure data exchange layer that gives service providers a completely new kind of opportunity of making themselves visible in services directed at citizens, businesses and civil servants. Creating entities that combine many different services and data sources is easy and cost efficient.

* Improves the quality of existing services and products
* Enables new types of service innovations
* Savings in infrastructure, archiving and other costs
* Standardised data security and privacy protection
* Easy implementation, data access via interfaces – after connecting all included services are available
