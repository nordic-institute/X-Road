    shortDescription: |-
      X-Road® is open-source software that provides unified and secure data
      exchange between organisations in a collaborative ecosystem.
    longDescription: |
      X-Road is a unified, cohesive,  collaborative, interoperable and secure
      data exchange layer that gives  service providers a completely new kind of
      opportunity of making  themselves visible in services directed at
      citizens, businesses and  civil servants. Creating entities that combine
      many different services and data sources is easy and cost efficient.

      - Improves the quality of existing services and products
      - Enables new types of service innovations
      - Savings in infrastructure, archiving and other costs
      - Standardised data security and privacy protection
      - Easy implementation, data access via interfaces – after connecting all
      included services are available

      X-Road implements a set of standard features to support and facilitate
      data exchange and ensures confidentiality, integrity, and interoperability
      between data exchange parties.

      ### X-Road Ecosystem

      An X-Road ecosystem is a community of organizations using the same
      instance of the X-Road software for producing and consuming services. The
      owner of the ecosystem, the X-Road Operator, controls who are allowed to
      join the community, and the owner defines regulations and practices that
      the ecosystem must follow.

      The ecosystem may be nationwide, or it may be limited to organizations
      meeting specific criteria, e.g., clients of a commercial service provider.
      Technically, the X-Road software does not set any limitations to the size
      of the ecosystem or the member organizations.

      ### Trusted Network

      Even if X-Road software is open-source, joining an X-Road ecosystem
      requires going through an on-boarding process. During the process, the
      identity of each organization and technical access point is verified using
      certificates that are issued by a trusted Certification Authority (CA).
      The identities are maintained centrally, but all the data is exchanged
      directly between a service consumer and a service provider. 

      Message routing is based on organization and service level identifiers
      that are mapped to physical network locations of the services by X-Road.
      All the evidence regarding the data exchange is stored locally by the data
      exchange parties, and no third parties have access to the data.
      Time-stamping and digital signature together guarantee non-repudiation of
      the data sent via X-Road. The logs provided by X-Road can be used in a
      court proceeding as evidence.

      ### Authorization Framework

      X-Road implements an authorization framework that is used to manage access
      rights to services. Access rights management is based on the organization
      and service level identifiers. 

      The key idea of X-Road is that each service provider owns its data and is
      responsible for managing access rights of its services. In other words,
      publishing service to X-Road does not mean that the service is
      automatically accessible to all X-Road member organizations. Usually,
      access rights are granted on the information system level – a service
      provider grants a specific information system access to a service.

      ### Monitoring and Reporting

      X-Road provides monitoring and reporting capabilities that can be used to
      collect operational reporting data and technical monitoring information
      from the ecosystem. The information can be used to measure the usage of
      individual services, understand dependencies and relationships between
      different information systems and services, monitor service health,
      monitor used X-Road software versions, etc. Each X-Road member
      organization can access its own data, whereas the X-Road operator can
      access all the members’ data.

      ### Cross-border Data Exchange

      X-Road provides built-in support for cross-border data exchange through
      federation, which means joining together two X-Road ecosystems. Members of
      the federated ecosystems can publish and consume services with each other
      as if they were members of the same ecosystem.

      It is possible to create federation connections with multiple ecosystems,
      but transitive federation relationships are not supported. An ecosystem
      does not have a federation relationship with another ecosystem that it's
      not directly federated with.
