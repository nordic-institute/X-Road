# Security Server docker image for GitHub actions

This file contains the Dockerfile and relevant setup files for running tests on GitHub actions. It relies on files from
the main Dockerfile used for the development image, but is customised slightly to use local files.

For more information, please refer to the
[original README.md for the develppment image](../../../Docker/securityserver/README.md).
