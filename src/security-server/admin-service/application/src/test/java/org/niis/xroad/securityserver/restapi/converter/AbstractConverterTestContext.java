 * Base for all converter tests that need some mocked beans in the application context.
 * All converter test classes inheriting this will have a common Spring Application Context
 * therefore drastically reducing the execution time of the converter tests
 *
 * Do not introduce new @MockBean or @SpyBean dependencies in the inherited classes. Doing so will mean Spring
 * creates a different applicationContext for the inherited class and other AbstractServiceTestContext classes,
 * and the performance improvement from using this base class is not realized. If possible, define all mocks and spies
 * in this base class instead.
