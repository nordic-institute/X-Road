/* Overrides for Vuetify variables
"Once installed, create a folder called sass, scss or styles in your src directory with
a file named variables.scss or variables.sass. The vuetify-loader will automatically
bootstrap your variables into Vue CLIâ€™s compilation process, overwriting the framework defaults."
