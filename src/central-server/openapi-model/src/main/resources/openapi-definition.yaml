        <p> This endpoint can also return metadata in the error response. The metadata array can contain error
          messages about why the init did not succeed. If the pin code is too weak, the error code <code>weak_pin</code>
          is used and the entries in the metadata array are always ordered in following way
          <ul>
            <li>metadata has a list of strings ["pin_min_length", x, "pin_min_char_classes_count", y] where</li>
            <li>x = the minimum length of the pin code</li>
            <li>y = the minimum amount of character classes (e.g. uppercase, number, special characters) to be used in the pin code</li>
          </ul>
          Other possible error code are
          <ul>
            <li><code>invalid_init_params</code> for "business" logic problems which can have any one or more of the
              following strings in the metadata field. There "_exists" -entries are returned if parameter has been
              given already in partially succeeded initialization. The "_not_provided"-entries are returned if these
              parameters is needed still for the initialization,  but it is not given in the request.
