#
# This is the "master security properties file".
#
# In this file, various security properties are set for use by
# java.security classes. This is where users can statically register
# Cryptography Package Providers ("providers" for short). The term
# "provider" refers to a package or set of packages that supply a
# concrete implementation of a subset of the cryptography aspects of
# the Java Security API. A provider may, for example, implement one or
# more digital signature algorithms or message digest algorithms.
#
# Each provider must implement a subclass of the Provider class.
# To register a provider in this master security properties file,
# specify the Provider subclass name and priority in the format
#
#    security.provider.<n>=<className>
#
# This declares a provider, and specifies its preference
# order n. The preference order is the order in which providers are
# searched for requested algorithms (when no specific provider is
# requested). The order is 1-based; 1 is the most preferred, followed
# by 2, and so on.
#
# <className> must specify the subclass of the Provider class whose
# constructor sets the values of various properties that are required
# for the Java Security API to look up the algorithms or other
# facilities implemented by the provider.
#
# There must be at least one provider specification in java.security.
# There is a default provider that comes standard with the JDK. It
# is called the "SUN" provider, and its Provider subclass
# named Sun appears in the sun.security.provider package. Thus, the
# "SUN" provider is registered via the following:
#
#    security.provider.1=sun.security.provider.Sun
#
# (The number 1 is used for the default provider.)
#
# Note: Providers can be dynamically registered instead by calls to
# either the addProvider or insertProviderAt method in the Security
# class.

#
# List of providers and their preference orders (see above):
#
security.provider.1=sun.security.provider.Sun
security.provider.2=sun.security.rsa.SunRsaSign
security.provider.3=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider
security.provider.4=com.sun.crypto.provider.SunJCE

#
# Select the source of seed data for SecureRandom. By default an
# attempt is made to use the entropy gathering device specified by
# the securerandom.source property. If an exception occurs when
# accessing the URL then the traditional system/thread activity
# algorithm is used.
#
# On Solaris and Linux systems, if file:/dev/urandom is specified and it
# exists, a special SecureRandom implementation is activated by default.
# This "NativePRNG" reads random bytes directly from /dev/urandom.
#
# On Windows systems, the URLs file:/dev/random and file:/dev/urandom
# enables use of the Microsoft CryptoAPI seed functionality.
#
securerandom.source=file:/dev/urandom
#
# The entropy gathering device is described as a URL and can also
# be specified with the system property "java.security.egd". For example,
#   -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/urandom
# Specifying this system property will override the securerandom.source
# setting.

# default value is forever (FOREVER). For security reasons, this
# caching is made forever when a security manager is set. When a security
# manager is not set, the default behavior in this implementation
# is to cache for 30 seconds.

# NOTE: setting this to anything other than the default value can have
#       serious security implications. Do not set it unless

#
# Properties to configure OCSP for certificate revocation checking
#

# Enable OCSP
#
# By default, OCSP is not used for certificate revocation checking.
# This property enables the use of OCSP when set to the value "true".
#
# NOTE: SocketPermission is required to connect to an OCSP responder.
#
# Example,
#   ocsp.enable=true

#
# Location of the OCSP responder
#
# By default, the location of the OCSP responder is determined implicitly
# from the certificate being validated. This property explicitly specifies
# the location of the OCSP responder. The property is used when the
# Authority Information Access extension (defined in RFC 3280) is absent
# from the certificate or when it requires overriding.
#
# Example,
#   ocsp.responderURL=http://ocsp.example.net:80

#
# Subject name of the OCSP responder's certificate
#
# By default, the certificate of the OCSP responder is that of the issuer
# of the certificate being validated. This property identifies the certificate
# of the OCSP responder when the default does not apply. Its value is a string
# distinguished name (defined in RFC 2253) which identifies a certificate in
# the set of certificates supplied during cert path validation. In cases where
# the subject name alone is not sufficient to uniquely identify the certificate
# then both the "ocsp.responderCertIssuerName" and
# "ocsp.responderCertSerialNumber" properties must be used instead. When this
# property is set then those two properties are ignored.
#
# Example,
#   ocsp.responderCertSubjectName="CN=OCSP Responder, O=XYZ Corp"

#
# Issuer name of the OCSP responder's certificate
#
# By default, the certificate of the OCSP responder is that of the issuer
# of the certificate being validated. This property identifies the certificate
# of the OCSP responder when the default does not apply. Its value is a string
# distinguished name (defined in RFC 2253) which identifies a certificate in
# the set of certificates supplied during cert path validation. When this
# property is set then the "ocsp.responderCertSerialNumber" property must also
# be set. When the "ocsp.responderCertSubjectName" property is set then this
# property is ignored.
#
# Example,
#   ocsp.responderCertIssuerName="CN=Enterprise CA, O=XYZ Corp"

#
# Serial number of the OCSP responder's certificate
#
# By default, the certificate of the OCSP responder is that of the issuer
# of the certificate being validated. This property identifies the certificate
# of the OCSP responder when the default does not apply. Its value is a string
# of hexadecimal digits (colon or space separators may be present) which
# identifies a certificate in the set of certificates supplied during cert path
# validation. When this property is set then the "ocsp.responderCertIssuerName"
# property must also be set. When the "ocsp.responderCertSubjectName" property
# is set then this property is ignored.
#
# Example,
#   ocsp.responderCertSerialNumber=2A:FF:00

#
# Policy for failed Kerberos KDC lookups:
#
# When a KDC is unavailable (network error, service failure, etc), it is
# put inside a blacklist and accessed less often for future requests. The
# value (case-insensitive) for this policy can be:
#
# tryLast
#    KDCs in the blacklist are always tried after those not on the list.
#
# tryLess[:max_retries,timeout]
#    KDCs in the blacklist are still tried by their order in the configuration,
#    but with smaller max_retries and timeout values. max_retries and timeout
#    are optional numerical parameters (default 1 and 5000, which means once
#    and 5 seconds). Please notes that if any of the values defined here is
#    more than what is defined in krb5.conf, it will be ignored.
#
# Whenever a KDC is detected as available, it is removed from the blacklist.
# The blacklist is reset when krb5.conf is reloaded. You can add
# refreshKrb5Config=true to a JAAS configuration file so that krb5.conf is
# reloaded whenever a JAAS authentication is attempted.
#
# Example,
#   krb5.kdc.bad.policy = tryLast
#   krb5.kdc.bad.policy = tryLess:2,2000
krb5.kdc.bad.policy = tryLast

# Algorithm restrictions for certification path (CertPath) processing
#
# In some environments, certain algorithms or key lengths may be undesirable
# for certification path building and validation.  For example, "MD2" is
# generally no longer considered to be a secure hash algorithm.  This section
# describes the mechanism for disabling algorithms based on algorithm name
# and/or key length.  This includes algorithms used in certificates, as well
# as revocation information such as CRLs and signed OCSP Responses.
#
# The syntax of the disabled algorithm string is described as this Java
# BNF-style:
#   DisabledAlgorithms:
#       " DisabledAlgorithm { , DisabledAlgorithm } "
#
#   DisabledAlgorithm:
#       AlgorithmName [Constraint]
#
#   AlgorithmName:
#       (see below)
#
#   Constraint:
#       KeySizeConstraint
#
#   KeySizeConstraint:
#       keySize Operator DecimalInteger
#
#   Operator:
#       <= | < | == | != | >= | >
#
#   DecimalInteger:
#       DecimalDigits
#
#   DecimalDigits:
#       DecimalDigit {DecimalDigit}
#
#   DecimalDigit: one of
#       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
#
# The "AlgorithmName" is the standard algorithm name of the disabled
# algorithm. See "Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name
# Documentation" for information about Standard Algorithm Names.  Matching
# is performed using a case-insensitive sub-element matching rule.  (For
# example, in "SHA1withECDSA" the sub-elements are "SHA1" for hashing and
# "ECDSA" for signatures.)  If the assertion "AlgorithmName" is a
# sub-element of the certificate algorithm name, the algorithm will be
# rejected during certification path building and validation.  For example,
# the assertion algorithm name "DSA" will disable all certificate algorithms
# that rely on DSA, such as NONEwithDSA, SHA1withDSA.  However, the assertion
# will not disable algorithms related to "ECDSA".
#
# A "Constraint" provides further guidance for the algorithm being specified.
# The "KeySizeConstraint" requires a key of a valid size range if the
# "AlgorithmName" is of a key algorithm.  The "DecimalInteger" indicates the
# key size specified in number of bits.  For example, "RSA keySize <= 1024"
# indicates that any RSA key with key size less than or equal to 1024 bits
# should be disabled, and "RSA keySize < 1024, RSA keySize > 2048" indicates
# that any RSA key with key size less than 1024 or greater than 2048 should
# be disabled. Note that the "KeySizeConstraint" only makes sense to key
# algorithms.
#
# Note: This property is currently used by Oracle's PKIX implementation. It
# is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.
#
# Example:
#   jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, DSA, RSA keySize < 2048
#
#
jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5

# Algorithm restrictions for Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security
# (SSL/TLS) processing
#
# In some environments, certain algorithms or key lengths may be undesirable
# when using SSL/TLS.  This section describes the mechanism for disabling
# algorithms during SSL/TLS security parameters negotiation, including cipher
# suites selection, peer authentication and key exchange mechanisms.
#
# For PKI-based peer authentication and key exchange mechanisms, this list
# of disabled algorithms will also be checked during certification path
# building and validation, including algorithms used in certificates, as
# well as revocation information such as CRLs and signed OCSP Responses.
# This is in addition to the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property above.
#
# See the specification of "jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms" for the
# syntax of the disabled algorithm string.
#
# Note: This property is currently used by Oracle's JSSE implementation.
# It is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.
#
# Example:
#   jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=MD5, SHA1, DSA, RSA keySize < 2048
