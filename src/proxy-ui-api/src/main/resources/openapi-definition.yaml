        <p>
          This endpoint can also return metadata in the error response if adding the service description fails due to invalid URLs, already existing service description or already existing services.
          If adding the service description fails due to an invalid service URL, the error response will have the error code <code>invalid_service_url</code> and the metadata will contain a list of invalid URLs.
          If adding the service description fails due to an already existing service description, the error response will have the error code <code>url_already_exists</code> and the metadata will contain the existing URL.
          If adding the service description fails due to already existing services, the metadata array will have a more complex format. See the description of the '409' response in this endpoint.
        </p>
        <p>
          This endpoint can return a warnings response which can be ignored by setting <code>ServiceDescriptionAdd.ignore_warnings</code> = true.
          If <code>ServiceDescriptionAdd.ignore_warnings</code> = false, a warnings response will be returned if WSDL or OpenAPI3 validation fails and validation warnings are returned.
          The warnings will have the warning code <code>wsdl_validation_warnings</code> or <code>openapi_validation_warnings</code> depending on which type the service description is. The metadata of the warning contains the output of the validator itself.

        <p>
          This endpoint can also return metadata in the error response. The metadata array can contain error messages about why the init did not succeed.
          If the pin code is too weak, the error code <code>weak_pin</code> is used and the entries in the metadata array are always ordered in following way
          <ul>
            <li>metadata has a list of strings ["pin_min_length", x, "pin_min_char_classes_count", y] where</li>
            <li>x = the minimum length of the pin code</li>
            <li>y = the minimum amount of character classes (e.g. uppercase, number, special characters) to be used in the pin code</li>
          </ul>
          Other possible error code is <code>invalid_init_params</code> which can have any one or more of the following strings in the metadata field
          <ul>
            <li>server_code_not_provided</li>
            <li>member_class_not_provided</li>
            <li>member_code_not_provided</li>
            <li>pin_code_not_provided</li>
            <li>server_code_exists</li>
            <li>member_class_exists</li>
            <li>member_code_exists</li>
            <li>pin_code_exists</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This endpoint can return a warnings response which can be ignored by setting <code>InitialServerConf.ignore_warnings</code> = true.
          If <code>InitialServerConf.ignore_warnings</code> = false, a warnings response will be returned if any one of the following conditions is true
          <ul>
            <li>server code has already been set for this Security Server (warning code <code>init_servercode_exists</code>)</li>
            <li>server owner has already been set for this Security Server(warning code <code>init_server_owner_exists</code>)</li>
            <li>software token has already been initialized in this Security Server(warning code <code>init_software_token_initialized</code>)</li>
            <li>the provided owner member is unregistered(warning code <code>init_unregistered_member</code>)</li>
            <li>the provided server id is already in use by another Security Server(warning code <code>init_server_id_exists</code>)</li>
          </ul>

        <p>This endpoint can also return metadata in the error response if sending an auth cert deletion management request fails. The metadata array contains the error details that were generated in core. The message is in plain English.</p>
        <p>
          Note that with this endpoint it's possible to delete an authentication key with a registered authentication certificate.
          <ul>
            <li>Attempt to delete an authentication key with a registered authentication certificate and with <code>ignore_warnings</code> = false causes the operation to fail with a warning in response's ErrorInfo object.</li>
            <li>Attempt to delete an authentication key with a registered authentication certificate and with <code>ignore_warnings</code> = true succeeds. The authentication certificate is first unregistered, and the key and certificate are deleted after that.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>When trying to delete an authentication key with a registered authentication certificate, the warning response has a warning code <code>auth_key_with_registered_cert_warning</code> and the metadata field contains the key id of the key</p>

              In this case the error code <code>service_already_exists</code> (WSDL) or <code>service_code_already_exists</code> (OPENAPI3) is used and the entries in the metadata array are ordered in following way

          This endpoint can also return metadata in the error response. The metadata array can contain error messages about why the init did not succeed.
          If the pin code is too weak, the error code <code>weak_pin</code> is used and the entries in the metadata array are always ordered in following way
          <ul>
            <li>metadata has a list of strings ["pin_min_length", x, "pin_min_char_classes_count", y] where</li>
            <li>x = the minimum length of the pin code</li>
            <li>y = the minimum amount of character classes (e.g. uppercase, number, special characters) to be used in the pin code</li>
