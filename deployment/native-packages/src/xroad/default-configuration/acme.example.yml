# Example acme.yml file that has properties related to Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)
# that is used to automate acquiring certificates from Certificate Authorities.
# To configure ACME, set the properties in the local.yaml file

# ACME external account binding credentials grouped by Certification Authorities(CA-s) and Members,
# where CAs have their name as key and should be surrounded by quotation marks to allow spaces.
# For Members the key is the Member ID in the form <instance_id>:<member_class>:<member_code> and
# should also be surrounded by quotation marks to allow for ':'. They have two properties: kid and mac-key, which should be
# acquired externally from the CA. If the CA supports kid-based certificate type selection, then credentials starting
# with the prefix "auth-" can be used to order authentication certificate and credentials starting with "sign-" can
# be used to order signing certificates.
# Property mac-key-base64-encoded should be true if the provided mac-keys are encoded in base64.
