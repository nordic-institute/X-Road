## Supported Versions

NIIS releases patches for security vulnerabilities. Latest version and two earlier versions of X-Road are officially supported by NIIS. The supported versions are defined on `MAJOR.MINOR` level so the release of patch versions (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) does not affect the support.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues and vulnerabilities are reported privately to the [X-Road Service
Desk](https://nordic-institute.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4) using the
`Report a software problem` request type.
[Sign up](https://id.atlassian.com/signup) for an account and
get access to the [X-Road Service Desk](https://nordic-institute.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4).

Another alternative to report security issues and vulnerabilities is the X-Road bug bounty program. [Visit the program details](https://nordic-institute.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/XRDBUGBOUNTY) to get started.
